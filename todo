THESIS
The professional performer and author of music is obsolete; music is now mainly a leisure pursuit.

OUTLINE
I used to want to be a rock star



When I was 13 in 1989, I wanted to be a Rock Star.  This was hardly an original ambition; it was pretty much the default dream of all my friends, and we were familiar with the standard trajectory to the top of the charts, gleaned from countless guitar magazines and cheap fan books: teach yourself guitar or drums; form a band with some school friends; gig tirelessly in your hometown, with occasional local tours; get discovered by a label; record a debut album on a modest budget; have the first in a string of hit singles, steadily climbing the charts; acheive worldwide fame, fortune, fawning groupies, etc.  To us, this wasn't simply a path to luxury and adoration, it was the most worthy contribution one could make to humanity.  Because we truly loved music, and to us, "music" meant something that was authored and recorded within the past 30 years and played on the radio.  At the time, we had no idea how anomalous that moment was in the history of popular music - how much it had changed in the preceding decades, and how much it was going to change in the decades to come.

Perhaps the most consequential aspect of music that I took for granted in 1989 but that was virtually non-existent a century earlier was the fact that it was recorded.  The rows of casset tapes that filled my local HMV music store, lovingly(?) enclosed in plastic cases, basically constituted the entire cannon of popular music to me.  My life's goal was to create a recording worthy of being stocked among that exclusive pantheon of pop gods.

There were rules to being an authentic pop musicians, and transgressions that my teenaged classmates and I were all-too eager to observe in those bands that we deemed unworthy.  Two of the most heinous sins an artist could commit were being unorginal, and selling out.  The true musical artist was expected to be driven by some loftier goal than wealth or fame (even though we, the wannabees, hypocriticallly craved both), and was also expected to have some distinctive inner artistic message, inspired by some ineffable, divine muse, and utterly original.  The role of the genuine Rock Star was to make a unique contribution to the catalog of pop, and to do it purely for the love of music.






From tavern to stadium and back

Music is at least as old as culture itself.  Its origins are debated but generally have some association with language, spirituality, and the rhythms of nature and the body.  As with all activities that we generally view as "art", music has evolved from a communal practice inseparable from ritual and daily life, to a specialized discipline practiced by trained experts for mass consumption.

Compared to other ancient forms of expression, music has had a particular intricate relationship with technology.  A painter applying acrylic to canvas is not so difffent from a paleolithic human used to scratch pigment into the rocks of Lasceaux.  Homer used essentially the same methods to compose the Odyssey and the Illiad as a modern blogger uses to write their weekly screed; the laptop certainly makes the writing process more convenient, but the conveyance of discreet words from author to audience is much the same, the only real difference being that those words are now passed from server to server instead of from bard to bard.

Music, on the other hand, is so intimately tied to the progress of civilization that it has been described as a technology in itself [cite].  This is most evident when we consider hardware, ie. instruments.  Chopin would not have been able to create his distinctive and highly influential Romantic compositions were it not for the dynamic range and controlled sustain afforded by the then-new piano-forte, and Jimi Hendrix could not have crafted his blistering sound that became essential to rock music if the electric guitar hadn't been invented a few decades earlier.  There has also been a more ephemeral technology at play throughout western music history, which is the twelve-tone music system to which all western tonal instruments are calibrated.  These twelve tones can be compared to words of a system whose complexity rivals that of a natural language.  Without this cultural institution, transmitted and refined from generation to generation, Thomas Tallis couldn't have arranged 40 voices into the dazzlingly complex 10 minute tapestry that is Spem in Allum, even though the only hardware involved was human bodies.

Dear Harold Klein,

This email is to follow up our verbal discussion concerning my occupancy of 5977C ave du Parc.

As I stated previously, I would agree to leave on July 1 2018 and relinquish all rights to this apartment if you paid me $10 000.

I will only discuss this matter further with you over email.

If you make threats that you know have no legal validity, eg. telling me you can evict me by a certain date when you can't or that a document is legally binding when it isn't (as you did with Nancy Moy), or pursue other intimidation tactics, I will sue you for harrassment as per article 1902 of the Civil Code of Quebec.

If you evict me based on plans with which you do not follow through on (eg. converting to offices), I will sue you for damages, and will inform any new tenants of the rent I was paying and their rights to a limited increase.

Also, please send someone to fix the lights in my bathroom and rear room.  I told you about this several weeks ago and you said you would send someone last Friday, November 3; I was home all day and no one came.

Sincerely,

Jeremy Eliosoff





Hi guys,


I went to the regie du logement today, here is what I learned:


The paper that Nancy signed.  The regie officer thinks *this paper is not legally binding* because Nancy's name is not on the lease.  For the same reason, any audio recording of Nancy making any agreement with K re. the apartment is not legally binding.  The officer said it would be a "courtesy" (which I assume means, good for the Moys, legally) for Nancy's mother to send a letter to K telling him that she does not respect the agreement he made with Nancy.  However, contrary to Mr. Bennet's counsel, the officer said no legal action has to be taken to invalidate the agreement; it's already invalid.  Even if Nancy's name had been on the lease, she might have been able to argue that she had been intimidated into signing the agreement, rendering it invalid.


Nancy's brother's deal with the garage.  This depends on whether the agreement (and, I assume, the garage) is of a residential or business nature.  For a residence, K has to go through the same process with Nancy's brother as with us - 6 months notice, 3 months rent, moving, etc.  If it's business the rules are different, but there are rules; the officer wasn't sure of the specifics (not his department) but he said 10 days notice sounded completely wrong.  I told him that, from my understanding, Nancy's brother had a very informal, verbal agreement with Mr. Hum for many years that K inherited, with no lease etc..  The officer said a verbal agreement can still have legal status if, eg., Nancy's brother can prove he has the keys to the place and has been paying rent for several years.


Harrassment.  If the paper Nancy signed and any corresponding audio recording is not legally binding, and if K can't evict her brother with 10 days' notice, and if K knows this - all of which I suspect to be true - then the only reason why K would make these (empty) threats to Nancy would be to scare + intimidate her.  Article 1902 of the civil code states, in full:

1902. Neither the lessor nor any other person may harass a lessee in such a manner as to limit his right to peaceable enjoyment of the premises or to induce him to leave the dwelling.
A lessee who suffers harassment may demand that the lessor or any other person who has harassed him be condemned to pay punitive damages.

I wonder if K's behaviour qualifies as "limit [the Moys'] right to peaceable enjoyment of the premises or to induce [them] to leave the dwelling."  I'm not suggesting the Moys sue for damages, but they might (counter-)threaten Klein that if he continues to make empty threats, they will sue him.


One lawyer represent multiple tenants.  Again contrary to Bennet's consel, the officer says there's no reason one lawyer can't represent multiple tenants if legal action is required, although they may have to show up for separate hearings for each plaintiff.


If K evicts us for a legal reason, eg. turning the flats into offices, and then fails to follow through (leaves them as flats), we can sue him for damages for dealing in bad faith.  There is some grey area, eg. K turns them into empty offices for 2 months, then back to flats, in which case a judge would decide.  A lawyer is not required.


I think the officer said that if we contest the eviction, we have to open a file for each unit for $75 each.  However, again, a lawyer is not required.


There are laws stipulating how much K can raise the rent after renovations - depending on, among other things, how much $ he spends on renovations - and these apply to new tenants as well as returning ones.  K can still ask for whatever rent he wants, but he has to specify in the lease what the previous rent was, and the new tenant can insist that the new rent be reduced to the regie-limited amount (assuming the tenant sees that part of the lease + knows their rights).  However, K can ask the tenant to waive this right, and he might be able to find someone willing to do so in this desirable neighbourhood.  This is only relevant because I may threaten K that I will send letters to the new tenant informing them of the previous rent + the approximate legal amount they're entitled to after reno (there are online calculators for this, though I'd need to get an idea how much K is spending on reno), although I admit I don't know how likely it is that I would follow through, or that it would have any effect, and I think K would suspect this.  Anyway, I listed my rent on this rent-exposing website, which I figure can't hurt:  https://myrent.quebec/



MY PLAN

As you may know, in my disastrous phone call with K on Tuesday, he raised his payout offer to $6000, but asked that I get back to him by Friday.  I think I will write him tomorrow and say:

I would agree to leave on July 1 and never bother K again if he paid me $10 000 (my previous offer).
I will only discuss things further with him over email.
If he makes threats that he knows he can't follow through on, or pursues other intimidation tactics, I will sue him for harrassment.
If he evicts me based on plans that he doesn't follow through on (eg. converting to offices), I will sue him for damages, and will inform the new tenants of the rent I was paying and their rights to limited increase.
Oh and by the way, fix my damn lights.

This sounds pretty bold, we'll see if I have the guts to follow through, but it's what I'm thinking.  My reasoning is: If it was possible and financially feasible for K to evict us, he wouldn't still be open to negotiation after a couple bargaining "deadlines" have passed (with me at least).  He would just send the eviction letter + pay the minimum (moving + 3 months rent).  $10K is cheap compared to the costs of the changes required to evict us (eg. joining/expanding units), and to the amount he could make with years of higher rent.  K has succeeded in making me want to leave this place, which now feels cursed, but I would feel better getting a bunch of $ from him, and I think we can.


That's all I got for now, sorry it's so long.  Let's keep in touch.


Jeremy.







What can he do to evict us?  Subdivide, combine, "enlarge", change destination?
	Is there a moratorium on combining business basements with residences in Mile End?

What defines harrassment?
	Making N sign a paper that has no legal status
	Saying he has a recording of above (irrelevant)
	Threatening to evict bro
	"98% chance I'm gonnna get you out of there" - would it be useful for me to have that recorded.

I told him about broken lights a few weeks ago, he said he'd send someone last Friday, I stayed in all day, no one came; now he's saying he'll send someone next week.

Can he evict N's bro from the garage?  Longstanding verbal agreement w prev landlord, transferred to new one, paid for this month.

Are they allowed to do internal renovations without our consent (if we haven't been evicted)

Are recordings admissable in court?  Should we be making them?

What is the process of eviction?  Landlord sends letter, we contest (open a file?)

Should we threaten telling new tenants prev rent?




?????? QUESTIONS FOR REGGIE ??????
Can K turn our flats into offices (zoning, permits)

If he does so just to get us out + then turns them back -> damages?

Can K hold Nancy to the paper if her name's not on the lease?  What of the recording?


Can one lawyer represent multiple tenants? Yes

What is a usual payout amount for our area?

Hear ye men where'er ye dwell
The bitter news I've come to tell
It's time to bid your dreams farewell
For Leah's getting hitched.

We've all been waiting for this day
We hoped it'd go another way
Yet now we learn to our dismay
Dear Leah's getting hitched

Of course we knew it couldn't be,
We couldn't match a gem like she,
But secretly thought "Well, MAYBE
To Leah I'll be hitched;

"It's like winning the lottery;
It has to hap'n to SOMEbody.
If not, I'd take a mere quickie
'Fore Leah's to be hitched."

Alas, this douche is here to stay--
From now, her one and only lay,
For he's the one who got to say
"Hey Leah, let's get hitched."

So cry your tears and drink you swill
To era passed, and hope that fell,
And wait to hear that fatal bell;
Sweet Leah's getting hitched.






Hey Anne

Well I must say, the prospect of signing over my rights to the apartment does not thrill me, and although I may have made it sound like I'm leaning towards doing so, I'm actually still quite conflicted.  I'm only considering it because Klein is making it sound like we ultimately won't have a choice but to leave, and he'll either pay us a sum to 'go quietly' or pay a (presumably larger) sum to architects + engineers to provide the documents that will legally necessitate our departure.  He has definitely stated in no uncertain terms that we WILL be legally required to leave, but of course that can be BS bluster.  I know he has cited article 1959, but as I said, it wasn't clear which of the 3 conditions - subdivide, enlarge, or change destination - he's planning on meeting, and the fact that he said he "might" do a business implies that he doesn't have a clear plan, other than do whatever it takes to get us out, which sounds like bad faith to me.

One issue is that, since K seems email-averse, it will be hard for him to contact me in the next few months, since I won't be reachable by phone, letter, or in person (although I could call him).  That's part of why I wanted to talk to him tomorrow, to have one more conversation about this before I go, largely for the sake of getting info from him, eg. for him to spell out (again) why he thinks he can legally evict us.  But rather than negotiating my "terms of surrender", I could use the chat as an occasion to let him know I intend to stay here, and I'm not convinced that his pro-wrestler-type assertions that we don't stand a chance against him in court are merited.  I could mention that I know many people who have successfully challenged lanlords' attempts to evict them (in fact just today a friend told me she did so).  He could keep that conversation in mind when he interacts with you in the next few months, since I won't be able to physically stand by you.

As I said, one thing I'm trying to assess is to what extent bluffing is a key part of K's MO.  I assume he has a pretty good idea whether or not he can legally force us out.  His story is that he can, and his buyout offer is just to avoid doing it the hard/expensive way (architect documents etc).  But maybe it is all a head game and he can only get his way by convincing us - falsely - that we'll lose in court, in which case, like you say, sending the message that we are obstinately in solidarity might be the best tactic.

So, if I DO want to stay and fight - which I'm leaning towards at this moment - do you think I should call him and tell him so, or just quietly slip off to Europe?

Also by the way, I've given him post-dated chequest through November.

Jeremy.


A friend of mine just told me that she won a case where her landlord was trying to kick her out so the landlord could move in; she convinced the court that the landlord had other options.  The point is, as you've said re. our neighbour, it's not unheard of landlords losing cases like these, and I presume their assertions of

Hello,

I've been a customer of iPage for 8 years.  I recently recieved notifications that payment to renew my account was due on June 20, but I couldn't figure out how to pay; when I checked my account online it looked like I was all paid up, or it was set to automatically renew.  To make sure everything was in order, I contacted your customer support chat line a couple days before June 20 to check that I was paid up, and the support person assured me that I was.  Then today, I saw that my website was not accessible, so I contacted the support chat line again, and the operator said that I had missed my payment deadline - I had paid for the hosting service, but not the domain name, and it would cost $16.99 to renew it.  I'm happy to pay that fee if it is the regular renewal fee, but I want to be sure that this is not a penalty fee for missing the deadline, since avoiding such a penalty fee was *exactly* why I contacted customer support before June 20.

So to reiterate: I'll gladly pay $16.99 if it is just a regular renewal fee, but I object to paying any late penalty since I think I took appropriate measures to avoid late payment, and customer support failed to assist me in doing so.

Thank you,

Jeremy.


Hi guys!  As you probably know, I'll be leaving town for a little while this coming Sunday, and I'd like to have a modest sending off before I go.  I realize it's short notice and it's St. Jean Baptiste Day, but I invite you to join me for a little picnic this coming Saturday.  Feel free to bring drinks, snacks, loved ones, offspring, etc. 

Jeremy's Sending Off 
Saturday, June 24
5is - 7ish pm
Parc St. Viateur (in Outremont between Bernard and St. Viateur
In case of rain we'll go to my place

Hope you can make it!

Jeremy.
Hello Nobodies!

I have a few [color=#0000ff]arsty[/color]/[color=#ff4488]trippy[/color] [color=#008844]video[/color] [color=#ff4444]loops[/color] that I'd like to share at this year's nowhere.

Attached is an example, which is looped once.  The versions I'll be bringing to Nowhere on a USB will be higher res, and will be available as just a single seamless loop, or looped 5 times to minimize the jitter that some software causes when it repeats a movie.

I'll probably have about 6 movies in a similar style to this one, each in single or 5x loop forms, with each loop being about 30s (the one attached is slightly longer, 38s).  I can show more examples to those interested.

If anyone in the community could use some extra content for their video projections, please let me know, I'd love to share these with anyone!  You can contact me at [b]jeremyeliosoff@gmail.com[/b], or find me on the playa.  My name is Jeremy, aka "Soloro", I'll be with Werkhaus and will be dressed largely in gold.

(Also, if anyone knows of a more appropriate place to post this request, please tell me.)

See you in the dust!

Jeremy.

QUESTION FOR REGIE

Do I have first dibs on post-reno apt?  If I make a deal with K, will/can I lose first dibs?
If he does make it into an apartment, can I inform whoever rents what the prev rent was with consequences?

Hello,

I would like know how feasible it is to use the Google cloud platform for a personal graphics project I'm working on (no GPU necessary).

I use custom python code on ubuntu linux, with my environment customized with various open source python plugins installed, eg. pygame.  I've been using my Dell inpiron laptop with 7.7 GB memory and 4 x 2.70GHz CPUs.

My code uses filmed image sequences as input, from which it generates other image sequence as output.  The input images are about 50 kb each, and each frame outputs about 19 images of the same size.  Image sequences are about 200 frames, so the total memory needed for one sequence is about 50kb * 20 images/frame * 200 frames/seq = 20 000kb/seq = 20 mb/seq.

The workflow I envision on Google cloud is:
Create an environment on the Google VM to google my laptop's environment ie. linux with custom open source python plugins.
Upload my custom python code, as well as the source image sequences
Run the python code to generate the output images
Download the output images

Would I be able to do this on Google cloud?  Could you provide me with an estimate of how much it would cost (monthly or hourly), using specs that mirror my own laptop?  (I think I only actually need 4GB of ram, not 7.7.)

Thanks,

Jeremy.

I expect politicians care less about the relatively small segment of the population who are actually transgender than about the much larger segment who have strong opinions about the subject.  Also, bill C-16 addresses issues, such as gender expression, which don't just affect transgender people.  I assume some elected officials have genuine concern about transgender people, but as a rule politicians mostly care about votes, so I expect you'll find plenty of posturing.

NON-CHOIR RELATED - Mile end apartment to sublet, June 25-mid November, $625/month, approx 900 sq ft.

Hello my friends!

I'll be out of town June 25 - mid November (kinda short notice I know), and I am looking for one or more sublettors to stay in my beloved apartment during that time.  I already have a contender till Aug 19 so I'm open to occupants for just the Aug 19-mid Nov stretch, but having one party for the entire July-Nov duration would be ideal.

The home is located on ave du Parc north of Bernard, in the super quaint, hip, charming, etc neighbourhood of Mile End, right on the frequently-serviced 80 bus line, 13 min walk from Rosemont metro, or 5 min by the semi-frequent 161 bus.

The apartment is a bit run down but extremely inexpensive ($625/month + electricity + internet) for its location and size (approx 900 sq ft), although the double-room in the front is my painting studio and is thus full of paintings and supplies.  There is a closed bedroom in the back with access to a balcony overlooking a lane.

Please feel free to share this with people you know and trust.  Interested parties can contact me by facebook, email (jeremyeliosoff@gmail.com) or at 514-435-4130.

Thanks!

Jeremy



Ha ha, I think I was a little lofty in my description of my project as "simulating how the eye works" -- although thank you for remembering!  Really I'm just trying to make trippy videos.  Friday fringing would be fun, although I have tentative plans with a friend that day.  Any chance we could check in day-of?  Sorry to be so noncommittal!

I know you just saved curToPrevSidDic but now we modify it, and
the curToPrevSidDics for all prev frames, such that each sid matches
the sid of each prevSid that it touches.

Each frame has a surfs dir that contains one curveFile per lev -- 000, 001, etc.
The curve file contains descriptions for each curve, which has:
  a cid - unique in this frame+lev, unchanging
  a sid - not necessarily unique, but unchanging
  a tid - not necessarily unique, unchanging

The hierachy is: a tid contains >=1 sids across >=1 frames; in each frame, an sid contains >=1 cids.
Conceptually, it would make sense to store all this info as a dic of tids:
    tids =
        {tidA:
            {sidA:
                {frA: [cidA, cidB, cidC],
                {frB: [cidA, cidB, cidC],
                    ...}
            {sidB:
                {frA: [cidA, cidB, cidC],
                {frB: [cidA, cidB, cidC],
                    ...}
        

**STONED EPIPHANY that might actually be brilliant**

The bad old way:
    record all the sids with all their curves + connections to prev sids
    go through the sequence again assigning tids to each sid, + when there is a merge,
        go back through the frames + repeatedly change the tids - MUCH REWRITING

The good new way:

    tidToBid{} -- eg. tidToBid[lev][tid] = set(bidA, bidB...)
    frToBid{} -- eg. frToBid[lev][fr] = set(bidA, bidB...)
    bidToTid{} -- eg. bidToTid[lev][bid] = tidA
    bidToCurves{} -- eg. bidToCurves[lev][bid][fr] = set(cidA, cidB...)

    in __init__, find a pickled dics for that seq; if there are none, init to {}
    in growCurves:
        when you first enter inSurfNow,
            if you are in prev bid:
                use prev bid:
                    bidToCurves[lev][prevBid][fr] = thisSurf
                    frToBid[lev][fr].append(prevBid)
            else:
                use new bid and new tid:
                    bidToCurves[lev][newBid][fr] = thisSurf
                    frToBid[lev][fr].append(newBid)
                    tidToBid[lev][newTid] = [newBid]
                    bidToTid[lev][newBid] = [newTid]
        if you enter a prev new bid (branches are merging):


...waitaminute waitaminute, take 2:
    in growCurves, maintain sidToPrevBids{} (similar to curToPrevSidDic)
        At each pixel, update: sidToPrevBids[lev][curSid].add(prevSid) (sidToPrevBids[curSid] is a *set*)
        When the the whole grid has been thus processed, process sidToPrevBids.  For lev in levs:
            for prevBids in sidToPrevBids[lev]:
                prevBidsSorted = list(prevBids).sort()
                bid = prevBidsSorted[0] # get min bid
                tid = 1000000000
                # Get min tid of prevBids
                for prevBid in prevBidsSorted:
                    tid = min(tid, bidToTid[lev][prevBid])

                # Unify tid for all prevBids
                for prevBid in prevBidsSorted:
                    if not tid == bidToTid[lev][prevBid]:
                        oldTid = bidToTid[lev][prevBid]
                        bidToTid[lev][prevBid] = tid
                        tidToBid[lev][tid].add(prevBid)
                        del tidToBid[lev][oldTid]
                        
YA SURE MAYBE.



XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX

Although I did not get a chance to visit Donut in my one previous Nowhere experience (2016), others have spoken highly of you, and from your description, you seem to have an ideal balance of thoughtful and silly, work ethic and fun, organized and laid back.

I don't have a specific activity or workshop to offer, but I would be happy to lend my energies and skills to events going on at the barrio.  I enjoy making visual art (you can see some examples here www.jeremyeliosoff.com) so I could help with decorative and/or creative projects.  I've also been creating short animated art-movies that could be projected during DJ sets if you guys have the facilities to do so.

I've been to Nowhere once, last year, and it was a magnificent, transformative experience, which made me rethink what is possible within myself and in society.

Tom Eliosoff <teliosoff@gmail.com> Sun, Jun 19, 2016 at 10:24 AM To: Ronald Eliosoff <reliosoff@gmail.com> 


Hi guys,

On the occasion of Tom's 39th bithday - the first that he did not live to see - I thought I'd share this note that he sent our dad on Father's Day last year:

hello Dad, 
You turned up favourably in some random reflections that I had jotted down last night. I read the thing when I woke up and found that the cringe factor while present, was not as bad as it might have been. So it is in a spirit humility and fun, that I thought I would share with you what I wrote: 
I could do anything now, so what should the plan be? I actually went through a brief phase trying to scout out real-estate. That never panned out but it wasn't long before the plan became obvious. The plan would be the same as the plan had always been, that is to learn how to play guitar the way John Coltrane played the saxophone. Not in the literal sense but in it's essence. A music both proud and humble, soft and strong, peaceful but filled with passion, from a place of urgent fervour but also soulful contentment. Notes that are fast in motion, but from a mind that is perfectly still. Inspired by spontaneous human emotion, but also guided by a meticulous order of divine intelligence. It seemed to me that the music of John Coltrane was as good a specimen as one was likely to find, of humanities greatest and most profound achievement. 
I was not a newcomer on this path since at the age of twenty seven, it had been eleven or so years earlier that I had discovered the music of coltrane and his contemporaries. I can remember that as I walked home from school for lunch, I replayed the music of Bill Evans in my head. So struck was I that my walk turned into a run.. and then a skipping motion. Pretty soon, I was having a full-on ecstatic dance down the residential street, lost in the music inside my head until I noticed abruptly, there was a man sitting on his porch! Embarrassed, I tried to pretend nothing had happened as I immediately resumed my normal walk. When I got home though, I went straight downstairs into my basement bedroom, listening to Bill Evans until I was late for school. Not concerned that I had missed lunch but only wishing I could listen further as I pried myself away from the stereo. 
It would be inaccurate still though to say that the path had begun when I discovered jazz in my teens. My love of music was instinctive for as long as I can remember. Even as a pre-schooler, when I was still familiarizing with the English language, one of my earliest childhood memories was of my babysitter Isabelle as we sat in the living room of my childhood house on Strathcona Avenue. In playful discussion, I was reflecting on my latest amusement. I thought it quite funny, that the words "magician" and "musician" sounded so similar, but they referred to such different occupations. A "magician" was little more than a well dressed clown, performing jokes and silly tricks for a laugh. My classmate Alex wanted to be a magician. But a musician, he was the one who's job it was to access that most mystical place, tapping into the divine, bringing forth a sound of mesmerizing beauty that turned men into angels, that spoke of words beyond words, giving us a glimpse of a world unseen, too bright for the eyes of humans. A musician was what I wanted to be.. that much was obvious! I would spend the rest of the afternoon with Isabelle, trying to decide which instrument to play. I figured probably violin but she was adamant that I should choose guitar, trying to sell me on the idea by saying that it was easier because it had frets. Hmm... I'll admit that seemed a bit suspicious. 
Although I could sometimes be quite demanding as a child, my recollection is faint but I don't remember there being much of a fuss leading up to my first guitar. There were things that I wanted and yearned for but all pretensions aside, it felt like music was something that I already had. So it felt quite natural when my dad walked up from his doctor's office downstairs carrying a guitar, not as a christmas or birthday present, but just randomly one day. Now I can appreciate how lucky I was to have parents who were tuned in. At the time, I remember feeling a bit excited about the spontaneous gift but also a bit self-righteous. Not exactly arrogant, but self-righteous in the legitimate sense, as one might feel when a lost object is found and returned to its rightful owner. The sentiment was echoed when my mother enlisted me for lessons at the local guitar school. I know this is pushing the limits of decency altogether but I couldn't wait to meet the teacher, so I could teach him how to play guitar! It's an attitude I occasionally draw criticism for to this day but I really didn't intend this with arrogance, conceit or bossyness. The teacher was a nice man named Bill, and he responded with Jubilant enthusiasm as I quickly made my way through the basic chord shapes. I won't deny that this made me feel a bit inflated as any child does when his ego is being pampered, but I was also eager for us to move on since we had work to do. When he told one of the other teachers that I was barely of walking age but already moving on to barchords, I might have responded with a look on my face that could be summed up by the phrase, "yeah dude, common??". One thing is for sure. When I had the guitar in my hands, I was in my element. 
Anyhow, happy father's day!! :-)

Hey Melissa,

Thanks for checking in.  I'm doing ok.  Actually, I'm almost weirdly fine.  I was a total wreck for the first few months after Tom died, but then the agony all kind of evaporated, and now I feel like it's practically a non-issue.  I think about him regularly, I have his guitar hanging in my room, he comes up in conversation - "That's near where Tom used to live" etc. - but none of this feels particularly triggering or anything.

I must say I'm a bit surprised, and a little wary, about how quickly and completely I seem to have gotten over this, given how close we were.  I think it's safe to say there was no one in my life more important to me than Tom.  We had lunch or dinner about once every two weeks, and would often exchange emails + texts in between.  He was a peculiar guy who certainly had his share of issues - he did die of a drug overdose after all - but we had a very strong bond and I valued our relationship tremendously.  For these reasons - and also from having seen others react to losing people close to them - I feared that his death would send me on some kind of tailspin, or at least permanently darken my worldview in some significant way.  Indeed, that was a major component of the horror of those first weeks; in addition to being currently miserable, I was fearful of what the future would hold, that I'd never really get over this.  I worried that the sheltered, carefree world I used to inhabit was gone forever now that I was part of what I've come to call the Bereaved Club, where the joys are always limited and the outlook is always grim.  But as it turns out, life is much the same, minus the bi-weekly Tom meals.  The human capacity to adapt to change is remarkable.  I was talking to a friend last night and I compared Tom's death to the election of Trump: at first, people were shocked and horrified and worried about what this dreadful new world would be like, but within a couple weeks they by and large just carried on with their lives.  So I guess that's what I'm doing.

I must add that the grieving process is known to be long and varied and unpredictable, so even though I feel pretty much ok NOW, there may be other, harder phases down the road.  And don't get me wrong, I still feel melancholy from time to time - for example, the emergence of terrace season is making me a bit blue, as it reminds me of the countless hours Tom and I have spent conversing on terraces.  But it's no biggie.  So, while I'm trying not to be too hasty in declaring myself "over it", I also heed the advice of a friend who lost her life partner some years ago: if you're feeling ok, don't question it, just enjoy it, because it might not last.

Those are my none-too-succinct thoughts about Tom these days.  Thanks again for asking.  I have to say, the MNC has played a particularly valuable role in helping me deal with this.  I'm not super close to most people in the choir, but just having a community of people who somewhat know me and are supporting me in this time really helps.  Thanks for being a part of it.

See you Monday, yes?

Jeremy.


Deliberate experiment
Reiterate works both ways

(Embellishing point 2: Some time ago, as I emerged into a kind of sexual re-awakening in my late 30s, I decided I would try to follow a policy for my sexual relations wherein basically no one gets hurt.  To temporarily adopt the inedequate cost/benefit quantitative appoach, if 2 people enter an engagement and person A gets 2 points and person B gets 3 points, all good.  If person A gets 20 points and person B LOSES 1 point, no deal.  This was partly to distance myself from Paul's policy, at least in his Hornivore heyday, which could be described as the Take Whatever You Can Get Away With Policy.)






Hey Lizzy

Glad to hear today went better.  It bodes well that your managers told you to not beat yourself up, especially if they were the same ones who disciplined Esther.  The fact that it's easier said than done for you speaks to your conscientiousness at work.  Any chance that snapping at Fiona will kind of "put her in her place" a bit such that maybe she'll be less abusive towards you?  Maybe next skype you can fill me in on the details of the incident.


Here are some thoughts on our Policy.

I've tried to apply analytic, flowchart-like thinking to this.  I knew that I was risking hurting you and damaging our relationship when I kissed that woman on Saturday, and more so when I went home with her.  On Sunday, I knew I was trotting out an old philanderer's excuse when I told you some version of "She meant nothing to me".  That begs the question, If she meant nothing to me, and you and our relationship mean so much to me, why did I take the risk?  I guess I partly hoped that the fact that she meant "nothing" would mitigate the damage to you, but it wouldn't eliminate it  (after all, she didn't mean literally "nothing") - so was it worth it?

Well, let's imagine (uncomfortably) that she meant "something" to me, that we had an exceptional connection or I found her spectacularly attractive or something.  Then my motivation for getting physical with her would be more understandable, but so would the potential damage to you/us, so there would be simultaneously more incentive, and more disincentive, to do so.

This implies the following rule, which we can call the Win/Lose Rule:
The more significant a fling is, the more understandable my (short term) desire to act on it, but also the more potential damage is done to you + our relationship.  In any case, ANY philandering would result in SOME damage.

(I assume everything in this discussion works both ways - we could replace "you" with "I/me" and vice versa - but for concision, I'll stick with embellishing on the current situation, where I am the flinger, not you.)

The question of how this rule should affect our behaviour depends on how much weight we give to the different factors.  If we're going to be utilitarian about it, it's something like: Is the gain I get from this fling greater than the pain it would cause you?

There are 2 main problems with this approach:
1. These values are not quantifiable.
2. Maybe we should just err on the side of avoiding ANY pain and only enter encounters that are beneficial to both parties, instead of tallying up the costs + benefits like we were doing a business transaction.  We can call this the Win/Win Policy.  (I made a conscious decision to try to adopt such a policy as I emerged into my sexual re-awakening in my late 30s, partly to distance myself from Paul's policy, at least in his Hornivore heyday, which could be described as the Take Whatever You Can Get Away With Policy.)

Obviously, there is a conflict between the the Win/Lose Rule and the Win/Win Policy.  Translated into practice, this means that any sexual activity I have with other people would risk hurting you, so if I truly want to respect the Win/Win Policy, such philandering would be prohibited, and the door on our beautiful cage would swing shut.

To be sure, I think the Win/Win Policy is a bit overly idealistic and simplistic.  It can't ALWAYS be "win" for both parties; when 2 people get intimate, it seems all but inevitable that SOMEONE's gonna get hurt at some point.  But it's a commendable ideal to strive to minimize that pain.

The complications come up when minimizing person A's pain entails restricting person B's freedom, even if that restriction isn't felt until it is tested.  Krys posted a somewhat relevant photo on Facebook today: it was graffiti on the steps next to the bathrooms that you used near the Tam Tam, which translated roughly as "WHOEVER DOES NOT MOVE DOES NOT FEEL THEIR CHAINS!!" (the "A" was an anarchist symbol).

Now, I don't want this talk of chains and cages to give the impression that I'm feeling constrained by or resentful of our relationship.  Definitely nothing you've said since this came up - or before - has made me feel that you have been in any way unfair or unreasonable or disrespectful to me.  But I think ever since we first articulated our Policy, at some level I suspected that we wouldn't really be able to assess its adequacy until one of us acted on it, at which point "the other shoe would drop".  And it seems that point is now.  (Also, imagine - again, uncomfortably - that that woman and I had done more than just make out.)


A few more thoughts:

I've found that many of the aspects surrounding this subject can be viewed and phrased in two ways, which we might call Old Fashioned vs. New Age:

OF: I want to free to screw as many ladies as I want/can.
NA: Restricting my sexual behaviour out of concern for another symbolically represents a loss of autonomy/independence/individuality/self, thus leading to the dreaded "merging" so chillingly illustrated in Edvard Munch's "The Kiss".

OF: I suffer from severe Peter Pan syndrome and am unwilling to step through the passages of maturity, especially those involving responsibility, such as the responsibility for someone else's emotional wellbeing that is necessarily entailed in a mature, healthy relationship.
NA: I am highly suspicious of the expectations and pressures that are imposed upon me as "appropriate" for each stage of life, not only by society, but by the insidious puppet masters in my genes that lure me along nature's suffocatingly pre-ordained script, eg. PAIR, MATE, REPRODUCE

OF: I am providing Lizzy with only what I deem to be the bare minimum investment to retain her emotional support and sexual availability while maxizing my own freedom and benefit.
NA: I am trying to work together with Lizzy to devise our own unique version of a relationship that allows us to give each other as much as we can of ourselves while respecting both of our desires for autonomy and avoiding the pitfalls of conventional relationships.

(Obviously, I'm hoping the NA versions of all the above are more accurate, and hoping you will sympathize more with them, but I'm trying to give fair consideration to both perspectives.)



One more thing I want to bring up is the matter of my coming post-Christian's-Wedding travels (as yet unconfirmed).  As I've mentioned, my Big Trip of 2014-15 pretty much kicked off the "sexual re-awakening" alluded to above, and that was by no means an accident; I think it's fair to say getting laid was the #1 motivation for embarking on the trip, and it did indeed pay off.  This time things are a bit different.  Between that trip and the few flings I've had since then, I do feel like I've largely "sowed my wild oats" (ie. got my numbers up), and proven to myself that I can indeed get laid.  Also, although I've much appreciated the joys of relative promiscuity, I've also learned its limits - the futility of endlessly pursuing more and more sexual conquest for its own sake, and the limited satsifaction of getting one's rocks off in a brief encounter with no further connection.  Having said all that, I can't deny that there is a significant temptation to continue to indulge in this newly broached realm of casual sex, and I know that that temptation will only be stronger in the ridiculously accelerated social/sexual environment of hostel/backpacking life.  Plus, this trip is meant to have a loose mandate of detaching myself as much as possible from connections to my normal life, as well as embracing Nowhere's "Radical Immediacy" principle, which spontaneous hookups would exemplify.  Of course, this is all in keeping with our non-monogamous Policy, and I recall that you recently specifically sanctioned sleeping around while I'm traveling, but that was before last Saturday.  Also, I have to say, when I imagine you back in Edinburgh, telling your friends and family about this odd relationship you have with this Canadian guy who is currently galivanting around hippy villages in India with free-loving backpackers, it feels a bit degrading to you, and a bit disrespectful on my part.



So those are some rather verbose musings on the Policy.  That ended up being quite a bit longer than I anticipated - I guess I can get pretty longwinded once I get started on something I care about.  Before I sign off, I want to briefly zoom out from the Policy to the Relationship.  As I think I've mentioned, this long-distance, loosely defined relationship with you is by far the most significant and exciting one I've had since Andree and I broke up 11 years ago.  You've become a happy and comfortable fixture in my life, even from afar.  I always look forward to and enjoy our skype dates, and am always thinking back to them and happily anticipating and preparing for them in the times between.  I'm amazed at how easy and good it felt to share my sacred personal space with you for 2.5 weeks (in contrast, for example, to the 2 nights hosting that German couchsurfer), and to share your space in Edinburgh.  I'm also pretty impressed that we were able to enter preliminary discussions about you moving here without either of us having a panic attack.  There is something about you that makes me unafraid to open up and share myself, to overcome my phobia of fully investing myself in other people.  Ironically, I think it's largely your very unobtrusive nature that's allowing me to do this; the very fact that you demand so little of me makes me want to give to you; the fact that you respect me for who I am and don't want to change me is inspiring me to change.  I stand by what I said at Pineda del Mar (and keep in mind I'm not prone to making grandiose statments in this context): this is rare.  If there were ever a reason for me to reconsider old habits and hang-ups and Policies, you might be it.

But there you go: "might be".  I'm still me.  I'm still uncertain, about pretty much everything, including the Policy.  But sadly, I think I - and you - have to GET certain about the Policy, at least certain enough to agree on it in practice.  That is evident now, which is why I don't regret what happened on Saturday.  I'm glad things didn't go further than they did, but I'm glad SOMETHING happened that put the Policy into practice.  I even think the timing was pretty good - a couple months before our next reunion, and me meeting your family, and me potentially going on this trip which I've come to think of as potentially a lasts hurrah of sorts before I buy a house, pick up a more regular work cycle... and MAYBE, if we're both game, enter wholeheartedly into a real, serious relationship.

Those are my thoughts, some of them at least.  I've tried to be pretty candid, and maybe my cold, blunt delivery has been a little abrasive at times, but I want to give you a fairly unvarnished view of what's going on in my head.  I'd like to re-emphasize that the examples I've given of ME having additional sexual partners applies equally to you, and although it hasn't yet come up, I'm quite certain that I would be profoundly affected if you had relations with someone else - although I'm not sure how the hurt and jealousy would play against the confirmation that this really is an open relationship.  In any case, I'm afraid I don't have any rock-solid conclusions from this - for example, how or whether we should revise our Policy.  But I definitely think we need to discuss it further, since as it stands, the Policy is not without problems.

No need to respond with anything approaching the same verbosity, we can just pick it up on Saturday if you like.  But I would very much like to know your thoughts and feelings on the matter, in whatever state they're currently at.

Missing you,

Jeremy.

Hello fellow tenants of Klein Palace,

As we all know, Mr. Klein wants us out.  It seems we will have to leave when our lease finished July 1 2018, though he would prefer if we leave before then.  (I don't know if Klein can technically force us to leave in 07/18, but I think he can at least make it very unpleasant to stay.)

Klein has suggested that he would pay us to leave early, although he hasn't said how much.  I spoke to him yesterday, and he said he doesn't want to make deals with each of us individually, he wants us to talk amongst ourselves and come up with an offer together, specifying when we would leave and how much he would pay us.  If understood correctly, we don't all have to leave at exactly the same time, but he wants all the units empty as soon as possible so he can start renovating.  He mentioned October as a kind of deadline, but also said that if we don't come up with an agreement by December, he'll send some sort of official letter ordering our removal by 07/18.

Mr. Klein has been quite vague on many details, which I think is partly because he is truly open to negotiation, but also partly to remain non-committal and keep us in the dark.  For example, he MIGHT be willing pay off SOME of us even if we don't ALL leave early, though he PREFERS if we leave at the same time, sometime this year.

One question I have is: If we can't come up with a proposal that Klein likes, can he force us to stay (at least keep paying rent) right up to 07/18, THEN force us to leave immediately thereafter, without giving us any compensation?  (He said he might have to pay moving costs.)  That seems unfair and counter to the principles of the Regie, given how much Klein is disrupting our lives.  One reason why I was willing to pay an extra $100/month for the 2 year lease was that it would give me time to find a new home, and I assumed this wouldn't be restricted to homes that can be occupied on July 1 2018.  I'm planning to ask the Regie about this on Monday.

As for myself, I'm leaving town in late June for an undetermined amount of time.  If we can agree to a deal that allows me to move out by then, I'd like to do so, then probably put my stuff in storage.  (Otherwise I'll make it a short trip, or find a sublettor.)  I'd want to reach this deal no later than June 1 so I have the rest of June to sort out my affairs, which means I would ideally like to propose something to Klein in the next 2 weeks.

I realize this is quite short notice, and I fully understand if we aren't all able to reach an agreement by June 1, but even if we don't, I think it's good to start communicating about our plans and intentions so we can make the best decisions possible.

So my main question for you now is: Do you guys know when you want to/are able to leave?  Are people interested in leaving before October?  If we establish that a sufficient number of are willing to leave early, we can start discussing the more difficult question of how much we would ask for (or we can insist that he make the first offer).

I have to say, even by the standards of Evil Landlord stereotypes, I find Mr. Klein quite unpleasant.  He repeatedly referred to us as "stubborn" and "taking advantage", as if WE'RE the ones making HIS life difficult.  Seems like classic mind games/gaslighting to me.  I'd say handle him with extreme distrust, and assume he'll only pay the minimum that the law requires.

I understand not everyone has their Klein-Palace exit strategy figured out yet, but I wanted to start the conversation so we can make the best of this rather unfortunate situation.


Please let me know your thoughts,

Jeremy.
















Hey guys, micro crisis on the website front:  I finally settled on a design - tomeliosoff6.wordpress.com from a few days ago.  My plan was to try a few variations (tomeliosoff, tomeliosoff2, etc), THEN figure out how to "move" the winner to tomeliosoff.wordpress.com.  Unfortunately, though I was able to move tomeliosoff.wordpress.com to a different address - thus, I assumed, freeing up tomeliosoff.wordpress.com - I could not then move tomeliosoff6.wordpress.com to tomeliosoff.wordpress.com.  It said the site was taken, though if you go there it says "tomeliosoff.wordpress.com is no longer available."  　  Note that the business cards with "tomeliosoff.wordpress.com" on them are already presumably already printed + waiting to be picked up.

I messaged the Wordpress help people and, quite astoundingly, received a response in about 15 min (for free!).  Seems the url is currently in domain limbo - she said it can take "up to 24 hrs" for the name to become available again.  So 


Hey guys, micro crisis on the website front:  Long story short, whilst attempting to switch tomeliosoff6.wordpress.com to tomeliosoff.wordpress.com, I deleted tomeliosoff.wordpress.com and can't get it back - for now.  According to the Wordpress support people - who were remarkably helpful, prompt, and free! - the url is currently in domain limbo; it is apparently in the process of being made available again, which can take "up to 24 hrs".  Note that tomeliosoff.wordpress.com is on those business cards, which are presumably printed and waiting for us.

It's not unthinkable that alternate business cards can be printed up tomorrow, but I think we take the leap of fiath that the site will indeed be free within 24 hrs.  I'll try to make the change during the day.

Sorry about this.  Anyway, the current state of the site is here: thomaseliosoff.wordpress.com.  It's much the same as when I last showed you guys tomeliosoff6.wordpress.com (many wasted hours ago), with a couple tweaks.  Jacob, I added your bio stuff with almost no modification, I thought it had a great balance of sentiment and fact and served the site's purpose really well.

RE. TOMORROW (assuming this goes ahead):  Any particular remaining tasks or preparations?  I'm gonna bring Tom's guitar (it probably won't be played, it's "for effect", so to speak), and I could also bring my semi-fancy camera and tripod and a clear memory card.  Anything else?

I'm tired but quite stoked about tomorrow.  I've pretty much settled back into normalcy this past month or so, but I'm starting to get a bit emotional again going through all these pics + recordings + communicating with Tom's friends.  I'm hoping tomorrow will be somewhat like the funeral, but much more relaxed + celebratory + less blur-like.  Hopefully we'll have time to properly chat with some of the jazz folks + others.

Jeremy.

Perhaps tomorrow morning - in addition to making a weather call about cancelling - I can try to get the domain again.  Should that fail, I *could* have an alternate business card design ready with the current url, thomaseliosoff.wordpress.com.  They have slightly more expensive 24 hour service; if I go at 8:30 when they open, they'll surely have it done by the time they close at 9pm.

I messaged the Wordpress help people and, quite astoundingly, received a response in about 15 min (for free!).  Seems the url is currently in domain limbo - she said it can take "up to 24 hrs" for the name to become available again.  So 



POLITICAL CORRECTNESS is the tendency to modify one's behaviour and beliefs to appear to be more progressive and egalitarian for the purpose of being accepted and approved of by a community.

This is distinct from having behaviour and beliefs that are progressive and egalitarian for their own sake, the key distinction being the motive of being accepted.
Tom was born in Montreal and spent most of his life there, but with years also in Brockville, Ontario, Toronto (where he graduated from University of Toronto with a degree in Jazz Performance), and as a working musician on cruise ships around the world.  In later years he found a happy rhythm in a sales job at local hospitals, but most of his life from his preschool years on involved music and it's as a musician that most of us remember him.
Tom was an outsized personality, quick to laugh, quick to opine, warm and direct.  In life as in music he liked to play with others but while following his own inner tune.  He was good with his hands and enjoyed taking apart his guitars and amps and reassembling them to his liking.  His resounding bass voice, his easy smile, his otherworldly expression when he played - these will not be forgotten.

He is survived by his parents Ron and Janice, his brothers Jer, Jacob and Dan, his dear friend Josée, Frances the cat and more bandmates, friends, students, audience members and others than we could have imagined.  If you have a piece of music, photo or other record of Tom you'd like to add to this site, just get in touch.


RIP.

Failure to make this distinction is what makes the pernicious aspect of political correctness so insidious.


EXAMPLE: THE REFUGEE CRISIS

The ongoing conflict in the middle east has resulted in a mass exodus of refugees from the affected areas to other countries, resulting in a heated debate regarding how many refugees other countries should accept, particularly in the west.  Here are some reasons for and against the proposal that western countries should accept more refugees:

FOR:
1. Western countries have a humanitarian obligation to accept people fleeing violence and oppression.
2. This obligation is particularly strong for some western countries, who have contributed to causing the conflict from which these people are fleeing.


AGAINST:
1. Middle eastern races are inferior to European ones and should not be permitted to tarnish western societies.
2. Middle eastern culture has aspects that are incompatible with western values, so western societies would clash with, and be compromised by, the influx.
3. Although there is nothing harmful about the vast majority of refugees, the sheer quantity of arrivals would strain the resources of the host country, compromising the welfare of immigrant and native alike.
4. Although there is nothing harmful about the vast majority of refugees, a relatively open-door immigration policy would make it easier for dangerous, ill-intended inviduals to slip through, compromising national security.
5. Although there is nothing harmful about the vast majority of refugees, many residents of the host country don't believe that, and their xenophobic, racist biases will cause them to react with hostility to the immigrants, resulting in domestic conflict, instability, and possibly the election of far-right governments highly unsympathetic to the "FOR" arguments listed above.

A few things should be noted about these lists.  Firstly, these arguments are not all necessarily presented as reasonable, valid ones (eg. AGAINST #1), but merely as views that people might hold, rightly or wrongly.  Secondly, the fact that there are 2 FOR arguments and 5 AGAINST ones isn't meant to suggest that AGAINST "wins"; it could very reasonably be argued that the importance of the 2 FOR points outweigh all 5 AGAINST ones combined.  Also, there are surely many other arguments that could be made on both sides that I haven't listed here.

I've presented the AGAINST arguments in an order that I consider increasingly palatable to those who favour equality, justice, and social progress (I'll call this EJP).  In my opinion, both FOR arguments merit serious consideration, and so do all AGAINST arguments, except the blatantly racist #1.  This is not to say all these views are immune from criticism.  For example, to AGAINST #3, one could retort that although the more refugees are accepted, the less effectively they could be accommodated, they would still be much better off that they were where they came from, and the sacrifices made by the host population are an acceptable - indeed, morally necessary - cost for the net benefit to humanity.  Nonetheless, AGAINST #3 is a valid point to consider in the discussion, and raising it does not itself imply a racist attitude, ie. AGAINST #1.

The problem with PC is that ANY of the AGAINST arguments listed - and indeed, many that aren't listed - can be perceived as sympathetic to AGAINST #1, simply because these are both on the AGAINST side.  It has been remarked that in PC culture, there is a tendency to isolate the worst possible motive someone could have for making an argument, and identifying that as their only true motive.  There is no point simlarly abhorrent to EJP values on the FOR side.  Since arguing FOR accepting more refugees can't easily be interpreted as immoral, while arguing AGAINST can, people err on the side of FOR, downplaying the important, non-immoral AGAINST arguments (2-5).  I believe that these arguments have indeed been downplayed, which is causing what they warn of to come true to some extent, particularly #5.

AGAINST #5 is of particular interest in that it addresses the difficult possibility that what the masses believe is actually wrong, factually and/or morally.  This is an essential problem of democracy in general, and its relationship to social progress, ie. not everyone is on board with the most progressive views, nor can they be readily forced on board.  A common way of confroting this problem among self-styled progressives is to basically INSIST that they get on board.  I find that many proponents of EJP values focus too much on theoritical ideals at the expense of practical realities.  They emphasise abstract concepts like "rights", and make conclusive, categorical moral assertions, using terms like "unacceptable" and "not up for debate".  Compromise is seen as acquiescence, and engaging in discussion with opposing views is seen as validating - and therefore endorsing - those views.  I presume this attitude derives from a deep confidence in one's moral values - and a corresponding disdain for opposing values - combined with a belief if they steadfastly assert these values, the side of truth and moral good (their side) will prevail, as if there were some natural law that the good guys will win.  I believe this view to be naive, as supported by the recent election of Trump.  Plenty of people thought that many of Trump's views were "unacceptable", and yet he got elected, whether you "accept" it or not.  Similarly, you may find it "unacceptable" that many Europeans are not comfortable with the recent influx of immigrants, for various reasons, but its "unacceptability" will not prevent them from resenting the situation and behaving accordingly, including electing sympathetic governments.

My point is not that it is senseless or useless to deem certain views morally wrong.  I do think it's a little nonsensical to call a view "unacceptable" when it is clear that other people have accepted it; it would make more sense to say "I don't accept this view".  However, even making this assertion is of limited use.  Certainly, it could advance your cause, in that a) it will get people thinking about your point of view, thus contributing to the intellectual "marketplace of ideas", b) it will send the message that you do not approve of this view, creating social pressure to revise it.

-----------------

Society gets compared to an imagined utopia, rather than to other actual contemporary or historical societies.  For example, it's not technically incorrect to assert that there is racism in Quebec


Values, and the policies they inform, thus get skewed in a direction that looks and feels good on superficial analysis, which, I believe, 


NOT EVERYONE, JUST THE LEFT - "approved by a community"



---------------------------------------




Hi again,

Last night I had a long, sometimes heated talk with my friend Jen about this little exchange.  She was relatively defensive of you.  In particular, she wanted to know why, with all the problems in the world, I'm choosing THIS battle, why I'm so concerned about the exact meaning of "77%" rather than the various injustices that go on around me, and why I'm attacking someone who is trying to do good in the world when there are so many more dangerous people out there.  I told her, as I told you, that I thought having a rigorous approach to determining the truth, including precise use of statistics, is essential to solving all the other problems.  She countered that I care about "77%" because it makes me feel blamed as a man, and the fact that I have the luxury to be upset about being potentially villified - as opposed to, say, my life being in danger - exemplifies the priviledge that I have.  Perhaps this echoes your view that my grievances are more about discomfort than nuance.

You said I've made up my mind and I don't want more facts.  I deeply want this not to be true.  I believe willingness to change one's mind is at the heart of productive discourse, and I do try to abide by that.  Part of why I value my friendship with you is because we do disagree about some things and challenge each other's views, but we usually have enough common ground to have a productive discussion about it.  I fear that by harping on that one statistic, without duly emphasising the very real problems are with gender inequality, in pay and other domains, I presented myself as an enemy to you and what you believe in.  This isn't the case.  I think we have 99% the same values.  I don't want to fight you and I don't want to defeat you.  I do want to understand you and continue to discuss things with you, and although I'm going to continue to present my views, I will try to be open to changing my mind.

No need to respond to this thread anytime soon, but I hope we can still be friends.

Jeremy.




Hi Jeremy,

How are you doing? Alex had been strangely distant with me ever since our high-school romance, so I do not feel that it's my place to be there. I do hope you are keeping it together so-to-speak. I'm sure this is having a toll on you. I don't think there is any other way to deal with death other than to try not to think about it, too much, just enough so that we don't take life for granted. Thinking about it too much gets depressing quickly. I look to my fellow cats for inspiration on the art of acceptance. But maybe this is no big deal for you, since you are Jeremy after all, and you don't seem to get phased by much.

You are more than welcome to hang out with me and my kitties in our oasis of peace (plus friendly french people), as I expect my Christmas to be once again quite peaceful this year. 

I got my home office setup this past weekend, so my obsessive personality is once again on the loose. Today I realized that I should enforce upon myself a 9pm coding curfew, because since Saturday, it's been nothing but work and sleep for me, and not very much sleep either.

Although life is too short to be working all the time, it's also too short to be broke and struggling all the time, so my motivation for working hard now, is so that I can work easy in the future. Because life is, indeed short. Still getting adjusted to the whole "40" thing, and "41" is suddenly right around the corner. Did I ever tell you I have a hard time watching "progress bars" when computers are doing stuff, because it always reminds me of the finite life we live. Damn progress bars.

Cheers,

- Derek


It seems Alex had grown distant from a lot of people, especially the last 6 years.  Some kind of fled when she got ill, many others  (eg. Jen) were cut out by Alex due to some perceived offence, others just drifted apart.  Dealing with her passing has been quite a process.  I'm flattered that you consider me relatively unphasable -- dunno if that's generally true, but in this case, yeah, I don't really feel devastated or anything like that.  I guess we had plenty of advanced notice.  I've been hanging out with her fam quite a bit (which was prohibited when she was alive), so I've been getting a lot of Fran's perspective on their extremely fraught relationship.  All very complicated, and with associated complicated, conflicting emotions now.  Anyway, Fran does remember you fondly, and is grateful to you for getting Alex out of her room for bike excursions etc when she was a teenager, but she totally understands that a lot of people have faded out of Alex's life over the years, so absolutely no pressure to attend her memorial.

I agree that the solution to the tricky matter of mortality is "don't think about it" - or, as I sometimes put it, "don't look down".  I also agree that life's too short to be working all the time, or to be broke all the time.  A difficult balancing act.  And yes, we're all on a progress bar, but it's usually one of those one's that bounces back and forth, indicating "unknown time remaining".  Would it be better if we knew how much time there was left?  We do have definitive progress bars per year though, and I too recently realized that I'm well over halfway through 40.  That was quick!

Glad to hear you're around over the holidays.  I'll be arriving in Ottawa on the 24 and coming back maybe Dec 28ish.  Would the 26 or 27 work for you?



In happier news, I just rebooted my computer and was greeted with the dreaded DOS-style "black window" (but not a window, the whole screen) that was telling me something about corrupt locations blah blah and said I had to use fsck, and I did, and after pressing y 100000 times, I rebooted and it seems to work!  I didn't even have to use my emergency Krys tech support speed dial resort.  Very scary for a moment there, though I guess we should keep these things in perspective.


Hey Angela, nice chatting you as always, certainly more interesting than Rogue One.

I don't mean to be antagonistic but as we were parting, you briefly referenced making 77 cents on the male dollar.  I didn't want to get into at the time, but it hit a nerve, especially as it followed our discussion of how suspicious people are of facts these days and the problems that come from oversimplification.  Are you aware of how hotly contested this statistic is?  Not the bare fact that women on average earn 77% of what men earn, but the notion that this is true ALL ELSE BEING EQUAL, ie. "for the same work".  Many critics of this view mention factors not directly related to discrimination - women choosing lower paying, lower risk jobs, being less likely to move for work or negotiate salaries, taking time off to raise a family and thus lacking experience, etc.  Granted, some of these factors may themselves be the effects of patriarchy, eg. less willingness to negotiate, pursuing "typical female" careers, and those careers being undervalued.  However, as I recall, you directly implied that if you were male, you would be making 23% more (or maybe 23/77=30% more) for doing your current job.  I think that is a misrepresentation of the research.  I invite you to see what the internet says about this.  (Spoiler alert: there is no consensus.)

Again this is not an attack, I'm just airing the usual thought-provokation that tends to follow our chats.  You surely know that I hate confrontation, but I hate poor reasoning around morally loaded subjects even more.  Retorts welcome, or we can discuss it next time we meet.

Jeremy.

I agree with your assessment of Trump, that his appeal rests on presenting himself as against/outside the system and speaking his crazy mind.  I also agree that he's now facing the awkward challenge of implementing his crazy promises.  But get this:  Trump's *official* plan for his first 100 days as president include starting funding for "the construction of a wall on our southern border with the full understanding that the country Mexico will be reimbursing the United States for the full cost of such wall".  !!!  How long will this ruse continue?  Or does he actually plan to do it?  Will he???  Anything goes at this point, but my hope is that, not too far into his (only) term, it will become evident that his administration is really too out of touch with reality to run a country, that "fuck the system" is not an adequate mandate for government.  Meanwhile, the Left, humbled and frightened by this blow, will change their tone, abandoning their sneering, superior rhetoric to focus more on dialogue, appeal, and even compromise.  This is my hope - and all without nukes being dropped.

I haven't seen South Park recently, I'm sure it's well worth checking out their take on all this.  Somehow I always find their toilet-humour satire much more wise and insightful and less partisan and pandering than the smugly superior smarm of the Jon Stewart gang (huge in N. America, less so in Europe I think), whom I largely blame for Trump.

*My* mum used to sing that Daisy song to me!  And she somehow managed to convey the affectionate sentiment and even the sweet melody in spite of being almost entirely tone deaf.  Maybe it's a standard lullaby.   Also referenced in 2001: a Space Odyssey "daaaaaaiissssyyyyy ddddddaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaiiiiiisss...."  Such a lovely tune indeed.

Speaking of the emotional power of untrained singing voices, the great Leonard Cohen died last night.  I have to say though, in contrast to the other tragedy of this week, I feel this one has a kind of agreeable poetic beauty.  LC has always sung, written + talked about death (when I entered this cafe they were playing his classic "A Singer Must Die"), but particularly so lately.  Some months ago he wrote a letter to his ex Marianne (immortalized in the song, again aptly titled, "So Long Marianne") just before *she* died, writing "I think I will follow you very soon. Know that I am so close behind you that if you stretch out your hand, I think you can reach mine".  Also, the lead single from the album he released a couple weeks ago (featuring my brother Tom's former Jewish choir) includes the suggestive refrain "I'm ready, my lord".  What a friggin artist.

More beauty-tinged morbidness yesterday: I visited Alex in the ER, overlapping a bit with her bro, then her mum.  Everyone was in pretty good spirits, but in our time alone, Alex caught me up a bit more on the situation.  Turns out my assesment that things aren't particularly worse than usual may have been off.  Her liver's starting to do worse again, which means her current treatment isn't working any more, and there are no other known options (the fact that this last one worked was apparently a minor miracle).  So again, though her disposition was remarkably sunny, chattering with fellow patients + staff etc., her words were grimmer than ever.  She said she was hoping to "stick around" for her birthday, which is in about a month, and was starting to talk about funeral arrangements, what she would leave to people, etc.  Watching her smile as she talked about how much use I might get out of her art supplies was fucking heartbreaking.   There were some gentle tears + hugging + such, but she really seemed quite at peace.  She said she's avoiding self-pity and anger, and indeed we tied in the election, and what I wrote to you about the questionable utility of anger in the face of crisis.  It was all super heavy, but really - and I apologized to Alex for this being such a cliche but there's no better word - really inspiring.

Lighter times after that, chatted to Findlay on the phone, he's coming to town this weekend staying at my place for some of it, which is great!  I'm looking forward to finally getting started on the final season of the Sopranos amidst beers and joints like old times, though I also wonder what Fin has to say about current events.  Dunno if I've told you but he's a huge believer in some pretty far-fetched conspiracy theories - I'm talking Egyptians and aliens and Freemasons and stuff.  Anyway, I'm looking forward to hanging out, and hopefully we'll also get to some more substantial conversation about his life.

After that, finally had a pretty epic catch-up with Jen, which (along with her roommate, whom we've both known for decades) included my first proper in-person conversation about the election.  I feel like this event is bringing out a lot of emotion and differences in people, and that was certainly the case with us, her activist proclivities bumping up against my fatalist ones in full force.  However, it was all respectful and reasonably low-temperature, and maybe even mutually productive.  Hopefully this bodes well for the world.

Your college-mate sounds like a real challenge.  What you describe would drive me crazy and fuel many hours of fuming and muttering to myself.  That suprior shaking of the head while your talking speaks volumes itself, and then the implication that she, unlike you, is actually guided by a moral compass and always does the *right* thing because she *knows* what's right is exactly the sort of thing I hate in ethical discourse.  Confronting her sounds like a good idea, but definitely a daunting task, not only because confrontation is scary in general, but because it sounds like your grievance - though totally valid and infuriating - might be a bit hard to explain.  But all this sounds perfectly fitting for the course, a great case study in dealing with people.  You don't think she's actually a confederate planted there to test the students do you?  Anyway, good luck dealing with that, I'm anxious to know how it goes.

Hey, kinnnnda related to potentially delicate discussions, I wanted to ask you something.  In all our hours of conversation in Edinburgh, we didn't talk all that much about "us".  That was fine with me - not that I want to avoid the topic, but it didn't feel like there was much that needed immediate discussing.  However, I do feel a little unclear as to how you'd like us to comport ourselves while we're apart.  As I recall, we basically agreed that we're both "free agents", free to have whatever relations we want with others, but we also couldn't deny the fact that such relations would inevitably have *some* affect on the other - at least if the other knows about it.  We mentioned possible "policies" about telling each other or not telling each other what we were up to, but I don't remember us establishing which of these policies we want to employ.  (Sorry to sound so "legalese" about this but I guess I'm pretty analytical by nature so my mind works well with somewhat clinical wording.)  To be clear, I have nothing specific to disclose or conceal at this point, but I can't deny that at least faint possibilities of intimacy with others do occasionally arise, and I want to be clear of how to proceed without disrespecting you, or anyone.  "Disrespect" here is not quite the same thing as "hurt".  For my part, I think if you told me that you had some other fling, it probably *would* hurt, but I wouldn't feel disrespected, as long as I felt you were taking my wellbeing into account to some "reasonable" extent.  (Is it a stretch to compare this to the distincion between the "ok" pain of LC's death and the "wrong" pain of Trump's election?)  Indeed, I might be a little bothered if I found out that you turned down some appealing fling just because you wanted to protect my feelings.  So basically, for my part, I'd like you to feel open to other escapades.  As for whether I want to know about it, that's a bit trickier: I don't *particularly* want to know about it, but it also feels a bit weird to ask transparent-faced, heart-on-sleeve you to omit such content from your updates; for me, anything close to a hook-up is pretty big news, and it's ommission would be glaring (but I can certainly censor myself if you like).  So ya, if I may, I'd like to defer the decision of what you do or don't tell me to you, but maybe just let me what your "policy" is beforehand, ie. whether I can expect to be informed of such activity on your part.  Again, I know we kinda touched on all this, but I'd like some reiteration/clarification.  (It's NOT that I want this in writing; indeed, if you'd prefer, you can think about it and we can discuss it "live" in our next chat, via whatever media.)  In sum:  Are you comfortable with me having intimate relations with others?  If so, do you particularly want to hear about it, or not hear about it?  I hope it's not too awkward a thing to bring up, but it was on my mind, and you know what they say: communication is key (even communication that is selective in a mutually agreeable pre-arranged way).

Sort of related: your hunch was right, quebecois *were* big on marriage, and had the highest birth rate, (I think) highest church attendance, and lowest education in Canada, but that all changed with the "Révolution tranquille" ("quiet revolution") of the 60s, where all that kinda flipped.  Not clear whether John, or Dominique, want kids, they might be both waiting for the other to show a strong preference on the subject.  He seemed so sort of say "que sera sera" which strikes me as a rather passive attitude for such a serious decision - so says the fatalist.

Oh my god, this was more epic than usual.  I think I might try to trim these messages down a bit, I just really like writing, particularly when the audience is so understanding and responsive and insightful.  But ya that's it for now.  Always look forward to hearing your thoughts on any of the above, though you don't have to painstakingly address all  my 10000 points.  Maybe I'll save most of my other thoughts for our next chat on Thursday (and ya, I WILL look into skype alternatives).

Jeremy.

Hi Mike,

Goddamn I seem to have lost my draft of this trip report!  Here goes take 2:

I decided to try smoking a bit of magic before the trip proper.  Around 2 pm I took a hit from my old pipe, again without refilling it - part of the process of "cleaning it" so I can re-designate it as a dedicated rue pipe.  I didn't really break through, but got to the point I usually arrive at at the "landing" phase of a breakthrough trip, where my body and the room were vibrating with energy, the contours of objects joining together in heilogryphic-type formations and separating themselves from the background, somewhat reminiscent of the patterns John Nash sees emerging from text in the movie "A Beautiful Mind".  

I waited for the magic to wear off and finally, after some hesitation due to weather concerns (it was a bit cloudy), I took the paper around 3:20 pm and embarked on my traditional 25-ish minute walk to the base of Mount Royal parc.  Again as per tradition, I felt myself getting "higher and higher" as I climbed the mountain, and when I reached the approximate "peak", I found a secluded rock in the forest to smoke my first joint of the venture.  At this point the the visuals really started to kick in, particularly the strong effects on motion that I mentioned previously.  The foliage around me was in full Autumn splendour, and the leaves became blotches of colour melting upwards like soft, slow flames.  I had great fun swirling my red lighter around in figure-8 motion, and watching specks of red trailing behind it.  I don't remember ever having such precise interactive control over my hallucinations before, and it felt like as I swirled, I was pulling along the threads that make up the universe.

There are downsides to being stuck on top of the Mountain on a whack of paper surrounded by strangers as the sun sets, and though I was never "bad tripping" per se, there were times I wished I could be teleported to the comfort of my bed so I could just gaze at fabric or something.  However, I was grateful for the ample hallucination fodder provided by my fellow sunday-strollers.  As I walked down the mountain's main, broad path, every time a cyclist passed me, they carried behind them a train of echoes, and when I reached the road, every car traced ribbons through the air.  The movement of vehicles seemed to reveal the clicking gears that are the clockwork of perception/reality.

Due to a combination of my natural disorientation, some unexpected path closures, and my unravelled mental state, I got pretty thoroughly lost, adding to the (mis)adventurous feel of the journey.  At some point I turned a coner and was greeted with a clear view of the sky, with massive, sharply defined clouds chruning and swirling in fast-forward, Baraka-style, and it was so beautiful that I loudly and involutarily exclaimed "Oh my GAWD!"  Eventually I was delighted to finally - and semi-randomly - come across my beloved lookout, with its iconic view of the Montreal downtown skyline - a favourite stop on my mountain trips, and just in time for sunset.  I watched the lights scintillating and the streets warping and waving around, my face frozen in a probably ominous-looking grin.  At one point I stood at the center of the lookout plaza, where the spokes of the radiating floor tiles met, and took in several 360 scans of the surroundings.  Although I could only see one section of the city, I felt like I could perceive the entire environment at once, and I felt connected to the city, earth, sky, and cosmos.

A bit later I was wandering around the mountain's summit, more-or-less lost again,  again not afraid but a little annoyed, but also aware that it was all part of the adventure.  As the darkness gathered and I trudged onward on my solitary journey - a bit reminiscent of Nick Cave's "Do You Love Me Part II" if you know it - the trees, black against the dark blue-velvet gradation of the sky, appeared to rise up as I approached them, giving the impression that I was descending, descending... into Hell, perhaps?  Behind the branches, rainbow-coloured specks of light began emerging, and I gradually realized that this was the LED-studded, rather kitschy cross that crowns the mountain and dominates the Montreal skyline, its white light splitting into a spectrum of colours.  I was half-jokingly reading all sorts of metaphorical meaning into this whole episode - I lost my way in the darkness, I followed the light and was restored by faith, etc.  Good fun.

One tricky thing about being on top of Mount Royal is that when you come down, you could end up in any one of various far-flung neighbourhoods depending on which route you take.  I was in no state to properly address the navigational challenge this presented, but I did eventually come to a road where there was a city bus at a stop, and I boarded it just as it was about to leave, not really knowing where it was going but hoping for the best.  Sure enough, after a thrilling ride down a wildly winding road, I was deposited right on Parc ave, ideally positioned to stagger home, which I did without incident.

The rest of the night was a mellow and pleasant comedown, featuring a bath that surely lasted well over an hour, sufi music, more joints, and then some restless flaking out in bed, wishing I could sleep - the usual and expected conclusion to my paper trips.  However, the insomnia was not too bad, and I think I dozed off around 3 am, leaving me about 4 hours to sleep before I had to wake up to catch a bus to Toronto.  Apart from some drained feeling, I felt pretty clean the following day.

So, again, thumbs way up for this batch.  I don't know how much to attribute to the magic pre-trip, sheer quantity, or the product itself, but the effect was a glorious combintation of sublime intensity, crystaline clarity, and lucid interactivity.  I look forward to revisiting this stuff this coming winter, perhaps for more indoor/introspective journeys into stucco, music, etc.  Might wanna combine with THC pills for their more long-term effect, and maybe experiment further with mixing in magic.

Thanks again for the connection,

Jeremy.



Hi Alex, and welcome to club Jew!  Of course I can't really legitimately welcome you due to my shiksa Mum issue, but I'm glad to hear you're officially one of the chosen people.  I'm curious about what circumstances led your Mum to this conclusion at this particular time, maybe you can explain that in person.  We must celbrate with some matzoh ball soup or something (if that's "kosher" for your diet)!

Sorry to hear about the sleep problems and chubbiness returning.  I could stop by for a little visit and grocery shop directly after I arrive at 8:30 pm tomorrow, if it's not too late for you.  Otherwise, Wednesday I'm free from the late afternoon onward, and Thursday until the evening, and then pretty open schedule after that, but I expect the grocery issue should be addressed pretty soon.  As always, if you can't predict your availability, we can make tentative plans and adjust them if need be.

Looking forward to seeing you!

Jeremy.




Hey Lea!  Sorry we didn't get to have a proper hang while I was in Toronto, any plans to come to Montreal soon?






I'm more or less free today until the evening.  Tomorrow I'm planning my semi-annual Autumn LSD Mount Royal climb.  If you're up for it, perhaps you could check in on me in that state, which I liked very much last time.  I can't guarantee that I'll be at my most stable or coherent or supportive, but maybe you'll find me a bit entertaining.  Failing that, I could talk on Monday; my brain will probably be recovering, but I should at least be conversational.  Next Tues-Mon I'm planning on being out of town and won't be able to talk, but after that I'll be back home indefinitely and at your service.

Briefly, my visit with Lizzy was basically a big success, like an idyllic honeymoon but minus the hassle of a wedding.  We were pretty much inseparable, meaning about 80% of the time we've spent together so far, including skype, transpired in these last 2 weeks.  It's a strange thing, meeting at a hedonistic festival, keeping in touch via skype and email, and then having a two-week intensive immersive relationship boot camp.  It definitely challenged our needs for personal space, both of us being usually quite solitary, autonomous people, and I think by the end we were both looking forward to having some time apart, but we savoured our fleeting time together to the utmost.  And now we are both on our separate continents again.  I feel quite satiated and content, and though I derive much pleasure plundering the store of memories we built up together, I wouldn't really say I'm sad to be separated from her, or that I feel an emptiness where she once was.  I'm also not sure exactly the significance of this relationship for my Montreal life, or for the future.  I am, however, looking forward to her tentatively planned visit here in April.

I hope my report of couply bliss isn't rubbing salt into the wound in your heart.  I also hope that in spite of the tragic turn with Saskia, the other things that you were so happy about before - friends, new chapter, career, and of course music - are providing comfort in this sad time.  I'm touched and honoured that you turn to me in bad times as well as good.

Take care my friend, and keep singing!

Jeremy.



Hello Lianne, and happy birthday!  Ok I won't pretend I knew it was your birthday before good old Facebook reminded me of it, and it seemed an opportune time to touch base.  I had been meaning to respond to your last message for a while, I just got too caught up with various things before my trip to Scotland, and then with the trip itself, to give this the attention it deserves.  As it happens, today is not only your birthday, but is also the deadline for this film fest I applied to, so now that that's off my plate, I have a chance to send a proper response.

I was so glad to read your last message, particularly the part about the Chilkoot trail.  What a story!  I especially like the despairing thoughts just before the Valley of Redeption, like the obligatory dip in spirits before the dramatic happy resolution of a thousand Hollywood movies.  You paint an vivid and inspiring picture of being out there alone in nature, and the vulnerability and challenges but also sublime sense of communuion and awe that it can provide.  It reminds me a bit of my big 8 month trip into the "wilderness" of Eastern Europe, the pitfalls and discomforts it presented, the doubts and concerns of well-meaning friends and family who are all too aware of my bumbling ways - and then the incredible sense of validation and fulfillment when I got through it, not unscathed, but stronger and more confident and maybe a bit wiser.  It continues to amaze me how much I hark back to that adventure and how much reassurance and just pure joy I still get from it.  So here's to taking on challenges and pushing our limits!

I alluded to another adventure that I just completed, though of a different nature: my trip to Scotland to visit Lizzy.  (Clarification: though she's been living in Edinburgh for 4 years, she's originally from Southwest England, and her accent is posh British, not rustic Scottish - still plenty hot, I assure you.)  So that was an intense experience: two weeks of being basically physically attached to another person -- quite unusual for a hermetic fellow like myself (and for her too, who is apparently a bit of a lone wolf under normal circumstances).  It was great though, and remarkably - almost suspiciously - free of conflict or tension, although I think by the end we were both a bit grateful to have our own space back.  So now we're apart again, and will likely remain so until at least April, when she has an Easter break from work and is tentatively planning a Montreal visit.  A bit awkward manageing a trans-Atlantic relationship, and we're both wary of putting too much weight on this or losing our autonomy, but surely something vaguely good is going on.

But for now, I'm back to my solitary, unemployed, Montreal ways.  That film I submitted today was a "work in progress", and the final verison is due early December, so I guess I'll be tweaking that over the next month, as well as getting to some short-term paintings, the last 3-month oeuvre being a bit of a disaster.  First though, I'm off to Ontario next week to visit some friends.  I've decided to postpone the job search, since my funds are holding up ok and I'm having a ball coming up with my own unpaid "work".

Speaking of work, you mentioned that you were going to wait for your 2 year anniversary at the Banff center to "change something".  Has that arrived?  Did you change something?  You said it also depended a bit on your boyfriend's situation.  Well I don't want to add pressure, but I do hope you find some circumstance more to your liking.  It's not uncommon to be a bit dissatisfied with one's employement, but I'm hopeful that an enterprising and competent person like yourself can find a more satisfying niche to fill in this vast, mad world.

Oh by the way, we went to Lush in Edinburgh and I was reminded of your enthusiasm for that place.  They do make a fine "bath bomb"!

Hope you've had a great birthday, keep in touch!

Jeremy.

Hello,

I'm planning to visit Porto from June 23-28.  If I stay at Magnolia Porto Hostel,  would I be able to send a package by mail to the hostel first and pick it up when I get there?  It's a box about 50cm X 50cm X 50cm.  If not, do you know if it's possible for me to mail it to a post office in Porto?

Thanks!

Jeremy.

Hi Pandora,

Thanks for offering your ragtradeslave skills!  I guess I should have known from your yarn bombing history that you'd be qulified for this.  Attached is a picture of the damage.  Sorry for short notice but do you think you'd have time to do it before this coming Friday?  How much would you charge?



Hi Ivonne,

Much thanks for your offer to help out with my seamstress needs!  Looks like I've got a few offers for this job, I wasn't expecting such a response!  For purely political reasons, I want to give Pandora first dibs on this.  She's the neighbour directly below me, and we have had a sometimes war-like relationship.  I viewed her offer as a peaceful gesture, so I'm gonna follow the principle (I think?) that trade, or gift-giving, makes friends out of enemies.  Maybe I've been thinking/reading/discussing too much about history, politics, international/interpersonal relations....

Anyway, I need it done by a week after tomorrow (I told Pandora next Friday cuz I don't trust her punctuality), if she says she can't do it by then, do you think you'd have time?  I've also contacted the Samantha person, we'll see who works out.

In any case, I have to go by your place sometime to deliver a canvas for that roomie of yours!  Maybe we could have coffee too or something?  Is there a particularly good time next week, apart from Monday, and Wed and Thurs evening?

Jeremy.

--------------------

Hi Samantha,

Thanks for responding to my seamstress post!  I was thinking of asking you to do this but I was worried it might be short notice, as I need it done by Sunday June 12 at latest.  But hey, if you've got the time, that would be great!  I've attached a picture of the damage.  I've also messaged a couple other people, we'll see who works out in terms of availability, time, $, distance.  How much would you charge?

Hey I also wanted to ask you about something else: I'm going to a festival in Spain and I'm working on a costume for Soloro, Spirit of Sunlight!  Think gold gold gold gold gold.  (No real gold.)  Would you by chance have time to meet up sometime next week to gimme a few pointers?  Perhaps we could have perogies at that Euro-Deli, I could bring my box of materials (I've been raiding thrift shops) and we could later have a little workshop in a nearby park (in the sunshine, of course).  I don't expect to actually work on the costume there, just brainstorm the design.  So far the costume consists of a vest (incredibly uncomfortable, hopefully to be replaced), a cape with a shawl thing over it, a sort of diaper-shorts thing (actually a repurposed tank top), a skirt, a big crown-hat thing, and various jewelery and accessories - all GOLD!  (Not sure what I'm gonna do about footware yet.)  I wanna keep it very simple, just a couple stitches + buttons here + there, but I expect your expertese could ensure things are comfy + rugged enough to survive the harsh Spanish desert.

As of now, I'm free midday pretty much all next week after Monday, with sooner being better so I have time to make the costume before my departure June 14.  Sorry for the short notice.  What say you?

Jeremy.

As it happened, Istanbul was a low point for me, as I got severely scammed out of mucho dineros my first night there, but it's all part of the ups and downs of traveling.




Hi Clara!

Remember me, the Canadian with whom you discussed American individualism, among other fascinating thigs, at Hostel Mostel in Sofia?  Woops, looking back I see I never responded to your last message - sorry about that!  In sum, I ended up traveling until mid-April, and all told, the trip was among the best experiences of my life.  I also see that in my last email I sent you an article which I should have preceded with many caveats, since I don't actually agree with much of its contents; the quote I highlighted was the main thing I liked about it.  Glad to hear you enjoyed Bucharest and Transylvania.  I ended up spending a bunch of time in Romania too later on my trip and also had a great time.

So, the reason I'm writing now is because I'm planning a trip to Spain in June and July and I wanted to pick your brain about travel advice.  I believe when we met, you were doing some sort of exchange in Istanbul, but according to your FB profile, you are from Seville.  There are so many places in Spain I want to visit but sadly my time is quite limited, so I have pick and choose, and it looks like I'll only have time to see 2 of these 3 places: Seville, Madrid, and Lisbon.  Are you familiar with these cities?  Which would you recommend?  I suppose what I'm mostly attracted to as a tourist is some kind of vibrant culture, in particular live music and dance, preferably of a traditional or local variety, grassroots as opposed to high culture.  I'm drawn to open mics/open stages where local performers jam, traditional fairs (preferably not just for tourists), and cozy coffee shops, rather than grand opera, high fashion, and glossy nightclubs.  I like what I've learned about Seville so far; as an authentic "sevillana" or "hispalense" (this is from Wikipedia), do you recommend visiting your hometown?  What about Madrid + Lisbon?  I'm also intrigued by Cordoba and the magnificent mosque/cathedral thing.  Worth checking out?  Also, are you yourself still in Istanbul, or are you back in Seville and perhaps available for a coffee sometime in the next couple months?  It's looking like I'll be in the South-West Iberian region probably in late June and/or mid-July.

Any input appreciated, thanks in advance, hope you're well!

Jeremy.

GROCERY DELIVERY
3550 Rue Jeanne-Mance H2X 3P7



Hi Alex,

Here is the intelligence I have gathered re. grocery deliveries.

First of all, I called Jean Coutu and they said they didn't do deliveries.  I thought they did deliver once to you, but was that an unofficial, "above and beyond" service that someone just did there voluntarily?  Anyway, the manager said no deliveries to domiciles.

Only the PAs accept orders online, the others deliver but you have to select the groceries in person.  Their online order form seems a bit informal - it's not like the online restaurant thing where you can check boxes + select menu items, you have to put descriptions like "3 granny smith apples", "el camino sea-salt chocolate bar" etc.  Sadly, none of the stores have discounts for disabled people.

Hope that helps, lemme know if I misunderstood anything or I can do anything else.

In other news, I still haven't bought my plane ticket, and I'm thinking of making a last-minute adjustment:  I'm considering shifting the whole trip 3 days later, so instead of June 10-July 15 it would be June 13-July 18.  This is so I can meet a friend in Barcelona.  From your perspective, it means 3 more days to get the laundry + shopping sorted out, but it also means 3 more days with neither me nor Jen in town.  Sorry for short notice, I just got an email from my friend today.  Like I say, I haven't bought the tickets yet and won't do so till tomorrow, so if there's a problem with these new dates, June 13-July 18, lemme know.

Hope you're having a lovely day and still basking in your good news!


Jeremy.





I am not sure if I can spend a lot of time traveling like you do, cause even after a week I want to go home, but things change and probably when I get old and crazy I'll do something like this 😊 what is "your Canada"? Sure, one place does not represent the whole country but people do, and since I've never been in Canada but met a few Canadians I may say I like this country and would not be sorry for that. It seems there are a lot of places you have not visited. What's your plan? About a job. It is actual lawyering and I like how it blows up my brain, so cool 😊

Ha ha, yeah you just might become a traveler when you're old and crazy like me!  I went through many phases of traveling/not-traveling.  Even just 5 years ago or so (which is very recent when you're my age) I had decided that my traveling days were basically done, but within a couple years I was on the longest voyage of my life, and loving it!  So ya, you never know....

What is "my Canada"... a good question.  Mostly Montreal I'd say which is a very special kind of Canada indeed; it is much more English-speaking than the rest of the province of Quebec, but Quebec is much more French than most of Canada, so Montreal is like a minority within a minority, and definitely has a different culture than, say, Toronto.  There's also the Praries, the Maritimes, the West Coast, and the mysterious, largely empty North... Having said that, I definitely found that when I was traveling, I met a lot of Canadians, and they did seem to share some common culture - and I did tend to like them.  Nice, smart, quiet, maybe slightly boring, but basically fine folks.  There are plenty of exceptions though, believe me.

My travel plan is still being created, all I know right now is that I have a ticket for a festival in Spain July 5-10.  Apart from that, I might go to Portugal, France, Italy, and/or Serbia (I know, Portugal would be the only new country for me).  I'm not sure how long I can be away from Montreal because I have some commitments here, but I'm gonna have to buy plane tickets soon!

So glad to hear you like your first job as a lawyer!  That's surely a sign that you have chosen the right career - not everyone likes their job, as you surely know.




Oh!  Well that's great that you found a job so quickly, congratulations!  Now you can save money for travel, and then afterwards you can come back to the job, or find another, which will be easier since you'll have work experience.  Well done!

!!LAURA!!

Hi!

I'm going to Spain!

I already told you that, but I want to buy my tickets soon, and I want to ask you about 3 things:

1.  I expect to be in Spain late June to mid-July.  What should I do???  I'll be occupied with the Nowhere Festival from 5-10 July, but otherwise I'll be free to party.  I'm trying to attend festivals, the theme for this trip, and I've come across a lot of them, but a couple that appeal to me in particular are the wine festival in Haro and the San Juan festival all around Spain.  Do you know about these festivals?  Are they worth attending?  If you think I should check out San Juan, where should I go for the most awesomely spectacular experience?  I'm counting on you Laura, if I don't have the best time of my life it will be your fault!  (not really)

2.  Are YOU going to be in Spain around that time?

3.  How are you?

Jeremy.


Really insightful observations Jacob!  One major reason why I quickly abandoned my blog when traveling, and hardly showed it to anyone, was for fear of being labelled as a gawking tourist from the affluent west using less affluent nations as my playground and offering my barely-formed 

Really insightful observations Jacob!  I was pretty self-consciousness about being accused of poverty tourism when I was traveling to less affluent countries, even though I was never in anything I would describe as a slum - it's one reason why I quickly abandoned my blog (another being laziness).  But I think actually visiting environments dramatically different from what you're used to can only help un-other the others, if you've got a somewhat open mind.


I don't mean to brag but I do love my humble, artsy apartment, and I think you might too!  It's not fancy but it's pretty big + nicely decorated, with a sizable spare room in the back that even has its own entrance.  There's also a nice big painting studio in the front, if that's of interest to you.  It's in the arguably-almost-too-hip Mile End neighbourhood of Montreal, about a 20 min bus ride from downtown, 10 min bus ride/30 min walk from the lovely Parc Mont Royal ("Tam Tam" drum circle/general picnic in the Summer).


Ha ha, that's awesome!  And so timely - I see this is the latest entry!  I also love all the little email headings - so packed with witty commentary.  (I see he's written a lot about email etiquette etc.)

Well if you're curious, there is a little update on my end.  Sarah finally wrote back, after about 10 days:

hey jeremy, i realise i didnt write u back. ill just talk to u in person.
:)


Not sure exactly what to make of that.  I'm tempted to think of it as a genuine, enthusiastic invitation talk later, but I see it more as a way of ending the FB conversation ASAP and dealing with the awkwardness later.    I was slightly tempted to write a Wait But Why style response, maybe even before she responded: "Sarah, I'm sorry if I was too forward and pressingly inquisitive in my last message.  I admit I do have a history of coming on a little too strong to women I'm attracted to, and getting borderline obsessive.  There was this one time..." -- but it was only a fleetingly tempation.  Instead I replied "Ya sounds good, enjoy the rest of your vacation."  Anyway, the truth is, my interest in her is only moderate, and though I'm troubled by how the convo went, it's not preoccupying me too much.  I guess I'll see her on Monday, hopefully it won't be too awkward.

Meanwhile, I'm kinda on the other end of a long-reply-wait.  I believe I mentioned this Samantha person I met at a halloween party, and with whom I've had a couple of lunches, at her invitation.  Well, a few days ago, she messaged me again, saying she liked Deadpool and "would love to discuss it or other things with you in the near future :)".  Oyoyoy... now, I've somewhat enjoyed our lunches, but I think at this point it's hard to deny the potential more-than-friends interest on her part, and total lack of such interest in my part, and the fact that my continued acceptance of her invitations is motivated mainly by my inability to say no to her rather than any real desire to see her.  So I'm thinking the decent thing to do would let her know that I'm not really interested, but how?  "Hey Samantha, thanks for the invitation, again, but I'm not really interested in you.  Maybe see you around, but hopefully not, cuz it would be awkward.  Good luck finding love, Jeremy."  AI, NO!  Then there's the "ghosting" option - just never replay, maybe de-friend, block.  All options suck, I just want to find the least sucky one.  (All this is what I've feared was going through Sarah's mind as well.)

Damn, why can't it just be like the movies where people meet, make a few endearlingly humourous blunders, and end up together happily ever after?

Anyway, thanks for the link, let me know if you have any comments or advice re. the above.  How are things at your mum's?  Still calm and amicable and borderline boring?


Jeremy.




















ahhhhh seriously? (about the rain) omg, dude i was the mall today (everyone's everyday activity -.-) and it rained like 6 drops! and people moved inside. word.

no way for startrek! like starwars was filmed in abudhabi desert!!! represent!! thats nice to know! yeah their airport is out.of.this.world. its just not an airport. but ive only been there once a few years ago, i bet it became the future now lol.

thats so swet to say! im coming back soon you guy! i miss it so much guh. 
ah im gna have to adapt to those changes, but no problem. change is nice. whose in lighting again? when it comes to 3d departments im sort of forgetful? tongue emoticon
and you're so lucky to see the freezing plants over there! ive taken a bunch of pics on my way to work once. its like a magical world trapped in ice! gasp emoticon

over here, its basically a futuristic city in a desert. everything is beige and greyed out because of sand and dust... i miss montreal. how did your painting go and your few days off?


Wow, Dubai sounds like a very unique place!  A friend went there and said it was like Las Vegas without drinking or gambling, would you say that's a fair characterization?  (She also mentioned that the Mall featured prominently in daily life.)  The closest I've been to Dubai is Israel and it too had a beige and greyed out landscape, which I felt had a kind of haunting arid beauty.  There was some sort of sandstorm while I was in Tel Aviv with blizzard-like intensity, hard to be outdoors and such, and it showed up on my phone's weather app as kind of brown cloud icon which I hadn't seen before.  All a far cry from the glittering winter splendour we get over here.  Have you seen the halo those ice-encased branches make around a streetlight, or the moon?  Very magical.

I was not aware that Star Wars was shot in Abu Dhabi!  Did you know that the scenes in the planet Tatooine in Star Wars was shot near the Tunisian city of Tataouine?  Also, let me get this straight: were you born in Abu Dhabi?  And then lived in Lebanon at some point?  And did you live in France or something, or am I just assuming that because you speak French perfectly?  And now your family is in Dubai?  Please clarify.

The lighters are: Bruno, Biagio, Brian, Kevin, Franciso (new guy), and myself.  (Hope I'm not missing anyone.)  I think we're getting a new recruit soon, and there are even murmurings that it might be a female!  The blokes are lovely, but that would be a nice change.

Sadly I did hardly any painting on my break, apart from painting this bed-addition thing I made, which ended up being the main project of the week.  I did however rejig my studio a bit, and did a quick "test painting" on Monday.  This last week I've been pretty busy, but I hope to get properly back into the paint next week, in preperation for a little cafe expo in May.

It's funny that you say you miss work, but I kind of get it - I've worked at a bunch of studios and AF is my favourite, there's a good vibe here.  I too missed work a bit on my week off - but 







Lianne!

Today is technically the last day of my week off work, and I'd written up a little TODO schedule to ensure the week didn't fly by without me accomplishing anything.  (Hot tip from some website: lists are not enough, if you want to get stuff done, schedule things.)  So Friday was my catch-up-on-emails day, and your name was on my list!  But you beat me to it.

So glad that your Hawaii idea is becoming a reality!  (Sorry about the dump, tho - at least you had something to be dumped from, which I haven't in a while -- better to have loved and lost etc.)  And with your best friend, fun!  For how long?

I'm at a bit of a pivotal point in my next travel plans, which have been brewing since before my last trip ended.  On Sunday, tickets go on sale for the first "anchor" of my trip, the Nowhere festival (European Burning Man) in Spain, July 5-10.  Apparently tix go pretty fast, so I'll have to be quick on the draw.  Buying them will be my first financial commitment to this next voyage, which has hitherto just been an idea -- but you know what ideas can become!  I think this trip will have to be quite a bit more planned than the last one since I'll be traveling in the high season; I'll have to reserve accoms in advance, which is at odds with my disorganized, improvizational style.  (I was initially only going to stay at that hostel in Ljublijana for 2-3 nights, ended up staying a week -- and I'm glad I did!)  It will be a good exercise though, and it might be a bit of a relief to have stuff more pre-planned, last time I spent much time + energy agonizing over what my next move should be.  The other major anchor of the trip is the Guca trumpet festival in Guca, Serbia, in early August, and there are a few other festivals along the way.  I may also be able to catch a folk/nature/art festival in rural Bulgaria in early June - a bit out of the way, but it looks like fun.  So ya, the theme of this trip is FESTIVALS!

My hair is officially too long, almost at my shoulders.  In my schedule, today was also haircut day, but it didn't happen - schedules can't solve everything I guess.

Winter is passing tolerably.  It's been a quite mild season, and I think of mid-Feb as pretty much the middle of winter (fitting that Valentine's Day is in the coldest, deepest heart of winter), so I feel like we're over the hump.  Working full time (except this week), much less stressful since our last project delivered (Deadpool, woo!  kinda).  It's a great gig, best I've had really, and I hate to complain -- but come on, 40hrs/week?  Who's idea was that?

Climbing and Yukon, sounds like fun Summer plans!  I've never been to Yukon but I've heard great things.  (Interestingly, I've heard pretty much nothing about the other territories.)  Dawson city is it?


Stay warm, keep visions of sandy beaches in your head!

Jeremy.


Where can I guy a super-cool wallet in Montreal?  Two "70s up" wallets bought at Eva B on St Laurent below Sherbrooke served me well for many years, but they're worn out + Eva B doesn't seem to sell them anymore.  Their winning qualities included:

Extra cash slot with zipper
Other zippered slot
ID slot with window
Chain loop
Awesome psychedelic design

Anyone know where I can find a similarly great wallet?

The more I think I understand, the more I feel it is futile to try to understand anything.


By the time the pol ended its’ South-West journey

And I find it strange I’ve never heard of anyone else noticing Cairo to London is almost a straight line northward, but so far it seems I am.

But for now, it would seem clear that the line-up of Cairo to London in order over time is clear.



Hey dude,

Sorry for the slow reply.

First of all, a couple of typographical/editorial corrections, in case you were planning on further disseminating this:



By the time the pol ended its’ South-West journey -- "pole", and "its" (no ').
 
And I find it strange I’ve never heard of anyone else noticing Cairo to London is almost a straight line northward, but so far it seems I am.  -- "I am" what?

But for now, it would seem clear that the line-up of Cairo to London in order over time is clear. -- I'd lose the first "clear".



Now for the content.  Unfortunately, your images didn't come through.  Can you maybe try sending them by email to jeremyeliosoff@gmail.com?  I'm curious to see them - from the context in which you refer to Fig 1, I'm guessing that it shows something like this: for each, or at least some, of the cultural capital migrations, a line points from old-capital through new-capital to magnetic north.  For me, that would really help clarify things and strengthen you argument.  I could comment further on the content of your piece after seeing the images - it's hard to follow all the descriptions of the capital- and pole-migrations without them (not a criticism of your descriptions, it's just a classic case where an image is really useful).

I know last time I was stressing the importance of having an explanatory theory about this pheonomenon.  This time you seem to be acknowledging the importance of this (the "Why?" section), and allude to explanations in further chapters.  That's cool, though I should say, in spite of my comments last time, I think if your images show a strong enough pattern, you can leave the explanation unresolved, as an invitation to further investigation/theories.

Some interesting trivia about Beantown, I didn't know about the oldest incorporated city part (nor do I really know what that means, but it sounds significant).  So are you suggesting that Brockville will be the next cultural capital?

Hey dude,

Ok, so as I think we've established, the print and the blank paper are of different proportions, which you can tell because height/width is different:

print: 28/21.5 = 1.302325581
paper: 76/56.5 = 1.345132743

This is assuming the height is larger than the width -- ie. you're using "portrait" orientation instead of "landscape".  So you'll have to either:

a) leave a bit blank at the top or bottom of the drawing

OR

b) leave out a tiny bit on the left of right of the photo.

For option a), you would be using the por

Hey Dan,

Well that does sound like a suitably rambunctious new years indeed!  At least you had alcohol as an excuse for not having your keys, last week after a completely dry "date" of sorts with Ange, who is on the wagon at the moment (and has been kind of insinuating herself back into my life - it was a nice evening though), I arrived home to find my pockets key-less.  They fell out in a cab, I'm thinking.  Fortunately I had a spare house key cleverly stashed in my mailbox, and my bike was not locked so lost lock key meant lost lock, not lost bike.  My new keys are all attached to my wallet, so there is no chance of losing my basket with all my eggs again, so to speak.

I had an almost surprisingly enjoyable new years.  John Williams hosted a gathering.  I was pretty low-energy and unsocial at the beginning, a bit exahausted having worked that day, but I got a second wind.  I'm trying not to gush too much to him about it though, he's already obnoxiously self-congratulatory about anything he remotely succeeds at.  I want to recommend to him (and you!) the documentary Cowspiracy, about the evils, particularly envirnomental, of the meat industry, but he'll be so bloody smug about it, vegetarian that he is.  Fortunately, the dairy industry doesn't escape indictment, I'll be sure to emphasise that (he's not vegan).  To be clear, I love John, he's somehow become one of my best friends over the years.  But, you know, friends, they're all bloody annoying in one way or another.

Work-wise, the movie we were working on has officially been delivered, crunch is over, and I am no longer a lighter.  And life is muuuuuuch better.  I was fucking up to the bitter end, including the very last shot I rendered - which was then processed by Ryan, co-founder of the company.  But at the bar where we were having wrap-drinks on Wednesday, Ryan snagged me on my way out to personally thank me for all my hard and "great" work.  I assume he personally tells eveyone this to keep morale up - it's very in keeping with the Californian work-is-family culture of the company - but what can I say, it worked, I feel better.  And for the last few days, I've been doing much more creative, problem-solving work, which is infitely more enjoyable than the oganizational demands and constant exam-like atmosphere of lighting.  Hopefully the remaining months in my contract - only 3.5 - will be calmer.

That's about it for the update around here.  I'm due a week vacation that I've yet to schedule, I'm thinking sometime before the end of Feb, maybe come to Ottawa for part of it (I didn't see Derek last time).  I'll probably pass on Dad's Las Vegas offer, a bit too hectic, and maybe a tad political re. Tom (not to deter you, it just might be weird if ALL the bros went and Tom wasn't invited).  (Without getting too into it, Tom and I finally had dinner for the first time since xmas a couple nights ago; it was reassuringly amicable, though family matters were not discussed.)  Is there a particular time that would would suit you best for an Ottawa visit?  And/or, coming to Mtl anytime soon?  No bedbugs in 4.5 months!

Jeremy.


Bonjour mon amie!

Comment ça va?

K I swear my spoken French is decent - and I've been practicing it more than usual with my Quebecois co-workers - but once I'm at a keyboard, I am pretty much uni-lingual.  Why must they have all those accents?  26 letters not enough?

Merry Belated Christmas!  Glad to hear you got lots of snow, I imagine Banff area has the full winter wonderland every xmas.  Here we had that weird El Nino weather, I think it was like 16 degrees on Boxing Day, but the snow came in time for New Years, and now it's regular winter.

Christmas was fun, in a wonderfully chill way - it mostly meant 3 days off work for me, which was a huge deal, as we were right in the deadline crunch.  The movie we were working on has now finished, and with it my employment as a lighter, thanks fucking God!  I hope no-one ever makes the mistake of tasking me with any job that requires organization ever again, eg. being a father.  Now I'm back to my preferred role of developing tools and systems for lighters to use, much more chill.  No fainting spells yet.

How are you?  How was/is your New Year?  Any updates on your travel plans?


Hi Rachelle,

Happy New Year!  And Happy New Life!  Sorry for the slow response, but congratulations on the person you have created!  



Hey stranger, remember what you were up to a year ago?  I came across this yesterday, I have a vague memory of you requesting the full song from Donovan when he was DJing, I thought you might appreciate this version.  How ya been?

http://www.superstarmagazine.com/how-under-pressure-sounds-without-music-freddie-mercury-and-david-bowie-a-cappella/

My relationship with The Schoolgirl has evolved to the point when we're now extremely awkward around each other and have as little interaction as possible, I actually actively avoid her, maybe she does the same.  This happens with me and hot women sometimes.  I think they just become so overwhelmingly attracted to me that it disturbs and offends their modest sensibilities, so they feel they have to stay away from me for their own emotional health.  Anyway, today I got to watch her absently lip synching along to TLC's "Waterfalls" as she worked, gently rocking her head in time.  It was the most erotic experience of my day, took the edge off the weekend workday.


Oh, xmas festivities on Monday sounds lovely!  However, I'm in an even less committal state than usual as crunch time crunches down at work.  Monday is one week before the original official deadline -- though I think there's been some kind of 2 week extension.  Still nothing like the horrors of MPC, but I am having mild flashbacks, and my fuse is running short.  I had a little temper tantrum today cuz something wasn't working and my zen coworker offered to help me but first he said "hey hey, don't get mad, if you're mad I won't help you".  I felt very ashamed of myself and admiring of him (he has a young son which I think is relevant).

All this to say, I will try to make it on Monday but all depends on work, is it ok if I wait till the evening of to confirm?  I'd put the probability of attendance at around 64.8%.

Jeremy.




Winter Is Coming, as they say!  Some snow has fallen, but not stayed.  I'm still in denial/procrastination mode in terms of Winter prep, and this mode often lasts through the entire season, biking through blizzards in layers of sweaters and rain jackets.  This winter it looks like I might get a proper parka though, inheriting it from my friend who died a few years ago.  I'm supposed to get it from his widow sometime this weekend.  That will be a little strange, I'll feel like I'm carrying a bit of Al with me wherever I go, but I expect he would have appreciated it.

Ya Himalayas sound exciting!  I wonder if you would feel at home there, being a mountain girl.  Has that Banff film fest inspired you to visit mountainous areas around the world?  I don't think I've ever seen any proper mountains other than the Rockies -- I didn't even see the ones in Bled because it was so damn foggy!  (Although I guess I did spy them from afar from that one "skyscraper" in Ljublijana.)


La Mancha!  Don Quitoxe!  I love that guy, insane traveller (although I have not read the book).

Toledo looks lovely, but I am worried that it will have too many tourists like me!  What about the specific town you're from?  Is that worth visiting/possible to visit?  And would you recommend anywhere in particular for MUSIC?  Flamenco is from south Spain yes?  I did go to Barcelona years ago and I loved it, but it was with my family so I had to behave myself, maybe I can go again in solo-traveler mode for a different experience.

Yeah that song sucks I'm sorry (although sometimes it gets in my head -- "LAAAAAAAAAAAAAUUUUUUUUURRRRRRRRRRAAAAAA").  Here is a more pleasant tune, also relevant.

Of course I remember you!  I remember that you say "you're kidding me" a lot in your Spanish-British accent.  See?

I went to Amsterdam already years ago.  It's a beautiful beautiful city, with its bicycles and canals lined with skinny buildings.  I would like to visit you there but I don't know if I'll have time, it's a bit out of my from my Spain->Serbia route.  Also I kind of had my fill of expensive Northern countries when I went to Scandinavia last year.  So you'll just have to come down and visit me in Spain!  Or Portugal, France, Italy....

Great to hear from you, stay in touch, and don't do too many drugs!

Jeremy.

Old-Time religion is a traditional Gospel song from 1873 or earlier.  While it has been theorized that the melody derives from an English folk tune, it had become a work song of African Americans in the Southern US by the 19th century.  Charles Davis Tillman, the son of a white Baptist Preacher in Alabama, heard an African American group singing the song at one of his father's camp meetings.  He wrote the words and the rudiments of the tune down on a scrap of paper and later published it as his own work in 1891, introducing it to a broader white audience.  The song is considered seminal in bringing together the traditions of white gospel and black spiritual songs to form the basis of a new style that came to be known as southern gospel.

Old-Time Religion has appeared in numerous films and TV shows, and I personally sang it in a high school production of Dark of the Moon, a play that deals with witchcraft and religious fervour in a small American town at the turn of the twentieth century.

Ok, let's try this again, this time saving my draft regularly.
0676767301
It's not quite that I'm not convinced.  I mean, you've drawn the lines on the map, it's pretty clear that these cities do line up in northwards trajectories and along the 35th parallels, so I'm convinced of that.  But I do remain sceptical of its significance.  It could be either a coincidence, or end up having some rather banal explanation.  I fear that the 35th parallel part of the theory might fall into the latter category.  Can't it just be that people stay in latitudes where it's warm and sunny, but tend to collect around the edges of those comfort-zone latitudes - ie. at the 39ths - so they can make excursions to the less habitable zones, which are less populated, and thus less plundered and more resource-rich?  That's just a very lay-person, brainstorming example.  The point is, more broadly, humans are pattern-recognizers par excellence, and though that accounts for a lot of our dazzling intellectual abilities, it can also trip us up because we start finding patterns and meaning in everything and underestimate the frequency of plain old, meaningless coincidence, eg. "The last 4 times I came to the butcher, the number I took ended in a 7 - it must mean something!"  (I'm not saying you would fall for that particular, obviously superstitious belief, but the tendency to over-assign meaning permeates our thinking.)  Did you hear about that study where they gave a bunch of people personality tests, then gave them computer generated personality descriptions?  Most participants said the descriptions were strikingly accurate, even though, as it turned out, they all got the same description.  It's confirmation bias; once people start looking for a pattern, they start seeing it everywhere.

Now, again, I'm not saying there's definitely no validity to what you've observed, the cities do line up quite nicely, enough to merit further investigation.  But one troubling thing is that "cultural capital" seems to me a rather arbitrary distinction.  I don't know the details but weren't there other cities that could be described as cultural capitals, eg. during the Middle Ages, while Europe was in relative chaos, wasn't much of what would eventually become Western Culture preserved and developed in the Arab world?  Plus what about civilizatoins in China and other Eastern regions, not to mention the Americas?

I think my main cause for scepticism particularly about the northward-moving capitals, apart from my generally sceptical nature, is that I don't see why this trend would exist, or through what mechanism it would become manifest.  Why would dominant cities move north?  Has there been some enviornmental pheonmenon or electomagnetic current that moves north that somehow draws people to it?  It's ok if you don't have an answer to these questions right now - like I say, it merits further investigation.  But you're implying that there may be some electromagnetic factor that has been essential in shaping the trajectory of major settlements in world history, and that has been overlooked by generations of scholars.  That's an extremely bold statement, and I think a lot people (myself included, I must admit) will be highly dubious that such a siginficant phenomenon would have gone unnoticed in such an ancient and thoroughly researched field.  The degree of collinearity of these cities is impressive, but in order to convince people that it's not a coincidence, I think you'd have to at least have the beginnings of a theory as to why it happened.  Maybe you could find someone who is sufficiently intrigued and qualified to help you flesh this out, but that person is not me.

I'm going to take a brief digression to talk about climate change.  Though environmentalists hate to admit it, the question of whether human caused climate change exists is disputed.  Of course, one may point out that it's not disputed by experts, but "climate change sceptics" (they apparently prefer this term to "deniers") might counter that these "experts" either have flawed methods that do not accurately reflect reality, or they are actively participating in some conspiracy of misinformation.  Well here's my take, as a lay person who doesn't understand all the science and hasn't particularly noticed climate change in my day to day life.  I've seen cities at night from airplanes, and I can see with my own eyes that humans have undeniably altered the landscape on a vast scale, and it makes sense that if you are changing the landscape so thoroughly, you are also probably changing the climate.  For this reason, I can buy that human caused climate change is real; even if I can't observe direct evidence with my own senses (it doesn't feel warmer), I can easily infer from what I can directly observed (big cities) that it ought to be happening, using very basic logic.  The case of your theory is somewhat opposite; you do have a result that can easily be observed - cities lining up - but you don't have a logical argument linking that to some other observable and accepted phenomenon, such as polar forces interfering with the electromagnetic activities of people's brains or what have you.  Until you do, I'll remain sceptical that this alignment has any significance, and I suspect others will too.

One other thing: is there not some conflict between the idea of cultural capitals moving north and them remaining near the 35th parallels?  Sorry if you've addressed this - and other concerns I've raised - in the paper.  I admit I only fully read it once.

Anyway, it is a well written paper, clear, concise, and to the point, and it does provoke thought.  It's just a bit outside of my field of expertese, and the very radicalness of the theory makes me wary.  Have you posted it on any geography/history type websites or forums or shared it with other people?  Maybe others will have more insightful reactions.

Jeremy



















Ok, let's try this again, this time saving my draft regularly.

I guess I am saying I'm not convinced.  I'm also not convinced that you're wrong.  I'm also not 100% convinced that any human has ever landed on the moon.  I consider myself a very non-committal person on many levels; in terms of entertaining theories, I look to the endless questioning approach of Socrates, and the boundless doubt of Descartes.  So if you're looking for conviction, you've come to the wrong place, but I am willing to consider this with you.

I do think these lines you've drawn on the map are worthy of note, and further investigation, but I do have some questions. First of all, forgive me if you addressed this in your paper, I only read it once, but isn't there some contradiction between the two patterns your proposing - that cultural capitals lie on the 35th parallels AND they have been moving towards magnetic north?  Assuming you have an explanation for that, what bothers me most about the northward-migration theory is that, while you've made a pretty striking observation about how these cities align, I haven't seen any explanation for why they would follow this pattern, what would compel humans to keep moving their settlements magnetic-northward.

Contrast this to the seasonal migratory patterns of some birds.  It's pretty clear that some bird species do migrate seasonally.  It's also pretty obvious why they would do this -- presumably to follow favourable weather.  I remember reading that it's not yet understood how birds do this - some theories about magnets in their beaks perhaps? - but it's generally agreed that there must be some mechanism involved, because they manifestly accomplish this impressive feat twice a year.

With your theory, as I say, you've observed an interesting pattern, but without at least a plausible theory as to why this pattern should present itself, I can't shake the suspicion that it is, in fact, a coincidence.  Humans are pattern recognizers par excellence, and although that

Hi Marika

Sorry for the very slow response to your text -- busy day at work, followed by evening work function/presentation and drinks with an old friend.  Thanks for the invite for dinner on Friday (which is indeed tomorrow).  As it happens though, I think I'm having dinner with my brother.  I should also add that, especially since I've re-entered the full-time work force, I've been slightly overwhelmed with all the hustle and bustle of life, and have been trying to err on the side of reclusiveness so that I can tend to some of my favourite solitary activities.  It would be fun to get together once in a while -- that Blanc de Blanc show was awesome, for example -- but please don't take it personally if I lay low much of the time.

Jeremy.


Sorry for the very slow response to your text -- busy day at work, followed by evening work function/presentation and drinks with an old friend.  Thanks for the invite for dinner on Friday (which is indeed tomorrow).  As it happens though, I think I'm having dinner with my brother, who I haven't seen in a couple weeks.  I should also add that, especially since I've re-entered the full-time work force, I've been slightly overwhelmed with all the hustle and bustle of life, and have been trying to err on the side of reclusiveness so that I can tend to some of my favourite solitary activities, such as painting, reading, smoking pot, and doing absolutely nothing.  As such, I probably won't be available for hangs on a very frequent basis.  It would be fun to get together once in a while -- that Blanc de Blanc show was awesome, for example -- but I just have to manage myself so that I can properly nurture the occupations (again, including much nothing) and relationships that I already have.  Does that make sense?

Jeremy.

It's been great hanging out with you and i

my plate is pretty full at the moment so I'm gonna have to manage my time carefully.  As I told my friend recently, I wish there were 2 of me, or 50 hours in the day, but we must

Wow, good day X5!  Good counts=week off, synth savvy stylists, and the long awaited and well-earned soundcard!  Sounds like you're getting all set up for a weekend/week/indefinite period of energetic creativity.

That second paragraph was right on.  Yeah I feel like Ange and I had about as graceful a breakup as possible.  (Still funny to call it that after a mere 2.5 weeks together.)

We still got movies to watch and such, we'll be in touch.

Jeremy.





Angela Angela Angela!  You did not bore me.  You were so, so much fun, in bed and out of it.  I loved your eagerness to jump in ice water, and your ability to impersonate a suana rock face, and you sure knew how to spoil a guy.  You did challenge me.  In fact, one thing I specifically like about you/us was that we have that wonderful balance of different perspectives and common ground, mutual empathy and respectful criticism, that created the perfect environment for great conversation.  I definitely felt when I was with you.  I felt great, I enjoyed your presence, and I loved how you made me feel about myself.  But it is true that there was always a little voice in my head that warned that things were sliding towards hazardous territory, ie. that thing I mentioned about us having different wishes for where things were going, and unbalanced emotional investments.  And that voice had gotten to a point where it was tainting all the good times, making them seem like they were just going to make the inevitable break even worse.

Please don't think that my running away has anything to do with shortcomings of yours.  You are beautiful and intelligent and considerate and all the good things.  Anyway, it's not about getting a perfect score in a bunch of categories.  The (very few) women who I've been very drawn to are not necessarily "better" than other women - in fact they're usually pretty odd in some way - and there have been plenty of objectively top notch women who held no interest for me.  It's not that you're not "good enough" for me, it's just that, for whatever reason, I don't think I'm as enthusiastic about what's been happening between us as you are.  If we were on the same page, eg. if you could really be happy to see me on a more casual basis with no wish for things to ever get more serious, then I think we could have had plenty more great times.  But it's clear that we want different things from this relationship, and I think that's a pretty classic sign of a bad relationship, and I don't think it can be fixed, because I don't believe people can will themselves to change what they want.

K I just got the bump from you to reply already, and I'm going to go visit my friend Alex.  Thanks for the warning, bracing myself for drunk messages.

One more thing: Please DON'T believe your mother, that this is at all about weight.  Yeah you're not skinny, but I sure as hell enjoyed your flesh, all of it.  I like flesh.  Remember the belly dildo/memento my first girlfriend made for me.  And, not to be crass, but I must remind you that the only girl I really considered myself to be in love with since Andree was Danielle Caddell-Malenfant, who is surely a size or two larger than you.  (BTW, I'm convinced a relationship with her never would have worked either, even without the Paul factor.)

Hi Marika!

Yup, I was sleeping when you left, didn't sleep much during the night because my super cheap and thin new sleeping bag was not suitable to the cool summer evening - which makes me wonder what it is suitable for.  Sleeping in the sun?  But ya, I was sorry I didn't get a chance to say goodbye.

So you mean you got your first choices for teaching?  Congrats!

Funny, I had JUST finished writing a diary paragraph about you when I checked my email, there was your message!  (Some further diarying ensued.)  Sorry it's taken me a while to get back to you.  There have actually been a few drafts of this message, which were stared at blankly for long periods of overthinking.  But yeah, maybe a park walk or something next week?  You gonna be at the BIA reunion/creativity display tomorrow?

Jeremy



ps. You may notice I've taken the liberty of "de-friending" you.




And again, I intended specifically to not message you again unless you messaged me first.

Hey what was the name of that super sad song you recommended to me?  I forgot to write it down.
Lovely to see you again yesterday!  I figure you've got a lot of social engagements and practical obligations in these last couple days in Montreal, but if you should find yourself drawing in a cafe again and want to talk about stuff once again, drop me a line.  And don't forget, last chance to catch the fireworks tonight!

Jeremy.

Hey Jen,

Man, I guess I hadn't realy physically exerted myself much in a while, I had forgotten that it's 2 days later that the pain comes.  Having some trouble walking.  Totally worth it tho.

Hey, I hope I didn't make you feel uncomfortable Sunday night.  I wasn't trying to take advantage of you in your croché (?) state.  I was just feeling kinda close to you and went with it, but it was maybe a bit reckless and pushy on my part, and I'm sorry about that.  Anyway, it was a super fun day and I was glad to hang out with you.  Like I say, I don't think I'll be available next 2 weeks, but afterwards we could maybe reprise Malaka madness.  Buds?

Jeez, just because you have some way of knowing that I'm online doesn't mean I have to respond to your 1:25 am messages in less than 20 min.  And just because I said I wanted to take a communication break till the end of summer doesn't mean we have a date on Sept 21.  I read some of your latest blog entry (I only ever search for The Painter of course) and I finally reached my limit of brushing off the hate and started to get a little angry.  To be continued, if you like.

I don't really care anymore. I don't think that we can be friends. I have a very distorted view of our relationship and don't remember the good parts, because the last two months have been hell. I went through a clinical depression. I've lost 16 lbs, mostly from just simply not eating (but now I'm just dieting. Thanks for the first 10 effortless pounds, I guess?). When I had contacted you a few weeks ago, and you refused to talk to me, the next day, I almost threw myself under a car. I haven't had suicidal ideation or depression for the past five years. I needed you. But to be clear, I don't blame you for my depression. That's medical and beyond my or your control. I am pissed at you for not being there for me as a friend when I needed you and that your excuse was an arbitrary date that I feel you have used as a control mechanism, regardless of how it made me feel. I can only assume that you have been fine, since I have no way of knowing otherwise, so I don't really even understand why you needed to hold that date sacred in the first place. And if you read my blog near that time that I reached out, I just wanted to hear that you were doing well and had moved on, that things were going well with your lady friend, or with a new lady friend, or whatever. Nothing more. It wasn't a big ask and I expect my friends to be there for me at a basic level. Hence, we can't be friends. Quite frankly, that's all that I've to say to you. 

I have finally moved on. I write about you a lot less. I have a lot going on and what's better, I have the energy to do things again. I'm seeing people, I'm working out, I'm rehearsing for Rocky, first show in five years, I wrote my play and I was contacted by the foreign service for a job, which I am going to take, which will most likely take me very far away from here for a very long time. I'm really busy, because as a back-up plan, the Paris plan is also being implemented, and I leave next week for the first trip and I still have a lot to do. I am very changed from when you last saw me. I doubt you'd recognize me at all. I'm not open any longer, the way that I was when we met. That's all done for now. 

I don't even know whether I should consider what we had a relationship or a fucking hallucination. It's all very far away from me. So I don't know if we should bother. It just feels like a trainwreck waiting to happen, or like picking at a scab. If you feel like you need to say stuff to my face, I'll make some time. I don't need to meet with you anymore, personally. I would however like your permission to speak to Tom again. It was nice to be able to check in with him a few months ago, and I would like to see how he is once in a while.


Hey Angela,

Well I'm sorry you were in a bad state -- though I must specify, "sorry" as in "my condolences", not as in "I apologize".  I didn't want to engage with you a couple weeks ago because I didn't feel that resuming our acquaintance from a place of you depending on me and me rescuing you was healthy for anyone, especially given how little time we had actually spent together.  The date was indeed arbitrary, and perhaps you are right that it was a control mechnanism, because your frequent messages (one of which was apparently sent from outside my apartment) in spite of us being "through" were causing me to feel like I had little control over this relationship, like I couldn't turn it "off" -- or at least put it on "pause" - without some setting some firm, specific parameters.  Did I tell you about the time I lost $1000 to scam artists in Istanbul because I couldn't say "no" - or rather, because I allowed my repeated "no"s to be disregarded?  It wasn't the first time I'd paid for that weakness, and this is where I'm coming from.  I felt that if your "need" (as you put it) for me was so strong that you couldn't wait 2 more weeks, I couldn't help you, and engaging would be unealthy for both of us.

You say you expect your friends to be there for you at a basic level.  That's reasonable, but I don't think of us as friends.  I thought, and hoped, we COULD be friends, but now, like you, I doubt it, at least in the forseaable future.  I'm definitely glad you didn't jump under a car, and that you're feeling better.  But, also like you, I don't see the use in us meeting.  There is nothing I particularly want to say to your face.  I would like to reiterate that I enjoyed our time together, from start to finish.  I don't know what kind of relationship it was, but it was something, and definitely not a hallucination.  The post-together fallout does irritate me a bit.  No one likes knowing that people out there are angry at them and are talking shit about them.  I wonder what exactly you are saying about me, how exactly you support your view that I treated you badly.  Who knows, maybe your right, but I don't see it at all at this point.  I suspect that you're falling for that very common, false belief that where there is suffering, there is a guilty villain.  Sometimes pain happens and it's no one's fault.

Anyway, none of this bothers me that much, it's just irritating.  In answer to your question, I am doing fine.  And feel free to contact Tom, I never told either of you how to act towards each other, his behavour is guided by his own decisions.  I'm truly glad you've got good, exciting things happening, and I wish you well.

Jeremy.

Hi Meghan,

Here's that artist that I thought your work reminded me of, though on later consideration I don't see it so much -- but I still find her paintings cool in a slightly horrific kinda way:

But of course, to my knowledge, neither of these people make bautiful little periscope-headed dolls with their paintings.  I saw your fluff-heads album on FB, so very cool!  You've really got a way with flesh + faces.  Do you have any other visual work online?
Anyway, grand to see you on Wednesday, I now officially "like" Fruiting Bodies on Facebook (FB on FB!) so I should alerted to upcoming shows.  Hopefully see you at one of those, or elsewhere!

Jeremy.


Allison!  So sorry for the very slow reply, busy times.  Heh, I wasn't quite sure where you guys were at these days and when you first mentioned your Shaughnessy village apt, I thought "Shaughnessy village... is that near Brockville?"  Given that I've spent most of my life in this town, my Montreal geography is pretty bad.

To my knowledge, there were no loose ends dangling when you guys left this apt,  all is in order, financially and otherwise.  I'm doing well!  Took most of the summer off after returning from travels, but I've been working full time since Aug 8.  It was a bit of an adjustment returning to the real/work world, but hey, that's where most people manage to get by, so no pity for me.  Sorry you guys had a rough summer, i hope your fall is looking better.  Any idea when you'll next be in Montreal?  it would be great to see you!

Jeremy.


Hi Signe.

Sorry it's taken so long to get back to you.  I've been trying to put my complicated feelings about you, and us, into words, but it hasn't been easy.  I keep starting a draft and getting stuck.  So I'm going to begin by stating the things I feel most certain about.

Meeting you was a truly pivotal event in my life, not just because you were the first person I had sex with in over 2 years, but also because with you, in a more general way, I felt like I had the privilege of experiencing the joy that two people can give each other, in a way that I hadn't for a long, long time.  For years I'd had all kinds of anxieties and complex philosophical theories about relationships, and was filled with conflicting feelings and desires about women and my relations with them.  But when I met you, everything seemed so wonderfully simple and natural.  Although there was always a faint, dream-like sense that it was too good to be true, I was amazed at how easy and comfortable it was to spend time with you.



I'm glad I stayed with you in Aarhus, both times, and I'm glad you came to Montreal.  I've also really appreciated our internet correspondence between visits, I always look forward to our chats and reread them and turn them over in my head afterwards, although it is true that since I've started working it's been harder to make the time for them.  But I really value your input, and I enjoy talking to you and hearing about your life.  Also, I really like myself when I'm around you, I like the version of me that I am seen through your eyes.  I feel fully appreciated by you, and I like trying to be a good friend and lover to you.

So that's one side of the equation.  On the other hand, I am nervous about where this relationship seems to be going, particularly on your side.  I'm worried that there will come a time when we'll have to end it, or at least remove all wonderful extra parts of the relationship that make us more than friends.

I have to stress that this has much more to do with my particular world view and approach to life than it does with our specific relationship.  I basically divide relationship types into two, "lover" and "not-lover".  There are lots of other ways of classifying relationships of course, but the "lover" distinction is important because, for my purposes, there can only be one lover at a time.  I know a lot of people are looking for a long term lover, maybe a spouse, maybe a parenting partner.  

And when we're physically together, all this is only amplified.  Not only do I enjoy you 




I think, for me, it has to be a matter of not just expressing, or discovering, how I feel and what I want, but more deciding


but I think it's important that we are as clear and honest as 



Hi Signe,

Sorry it's taken so long to get back to you.  I've been trying to put my complicated feelings about you, and us, into words, but it hasn't been easy.  I keep starting a draft and getting stuck.  So I'm going to begin by stating the things I feel most certain about.

I like you.  I'm very glad I met you.  I like being around you, I like how I feel about myself when I'm around you.  I like playing the part of your lover, pleasing you and receiving pleasure from you, in all kinds of ways.  When I'm with you, I feel like I'm living in some idealized fantasy life, and I like that feeling a lot.

I think the problem I'm facing right now has to do with this fantasy aspect of our relationship.  I seem to have an aversion to "real" relationships, by which I mean committed, monogamous relations with no end in sight.  I think it all comes down to that Edvard Munch painting, the merging of the self with the lover and loss of one's individuality.  I'm a person who deeply values their autonomy and personal space.  Now that I'm working full time, I complain a lot about not having enough time, and a lot of that is about not having enough time to myself (this is why I don't often eat with my co-workers).  I know a lot of people like the idea of having someone waiting for them when they get home, and some of my co-workers will regularly meet their spouses for lunch, as if they can't even wait till after work to see them again.  While I definitely empathize with this on some level, the propect of coming home to someone every day, indefinitely, does not appeal to me.  I don't know to what extent has always been true about me, or whether I've become more isolated in my years of being single.  I know that even in my 5-6 year relationship with Andree, much of it was long distance, and she believed that I preferred it that way, that I preferred having a "fantasy girlfriend" who I loved and who loved me but who I didn't have to deal with on a day to day basis.  I think she was right to some degree, and I definitely think it was my non-committalness and need for space that eventually ended that relationship.

With you, part of me felt like we hit this perfect balance, like I could slip into this life of couply bliss with my ideal lover, and then slip out before it got too constrictive.  I could have my cake and eat it too.  And it was blissful indeed while we were together.  I loved telling each other about our work day (each at different times, Oct vs. Aug), exploring corners of Aarhus and Montreal together, keeping in touch on the internet.  And I must say, this also pertains to those second, platonic two weeks in Aarhus; even without the incredible sex, I really enjoyed just watching movies, playing games, and having those pre-work oatmeal breakfast chats by the window with you.  But all along, there was a nagging question in the back of my mind: Where is this going?  Of course, this is a question that can drive you crazy in any realm of life - Why am I painting?  Why am I making money, traveling, or even bothering keeping myself alive?  Where is ANY of this going?  But with most aspects of my life, I can just live with these open ended questions, whereas with this one, it's harder to do that, because another person is involved: you.  I feel like you are entitled to an answer, and I guess this email is my attempt to give you one.

Here is my main concern about our relationship right now:  I'm worried that I'm going to meet someone else, and that's going to be painful for you, and for me.  It's possible that the reverse will happen, that you'll meet someone, and I'll hurt, but I'm honestly not as worried about that.  Of course I would love to see you again, to have yet another wonderful installment of the Story of Signe and Jeremy.  But I worry that, at least on some level, each visit we have makes you more invested in this relationship and in an imagined future together.  Honestly, I don't see that future.  It's not that I can clearly see how our relationship will end, and it's certainly not that I more clearly envision someone else in my future.  It's more that I don't want to think about the future at all,  and I sense that we are diverging in this aspect, in how future-oriented we are viewing this relationship.  I'm definitely not saying that there's anything wrong with looking towards the future, and indeed I think it's a very common and natural way to think about relationships, and I feel like I have a really exceptional aversion to future-thinking, even for a male.  Indeed, one may wonder if MY attitude is unhealthy, and if in a few years I'll regret not having better prepared.  But for now, I have very clear feeling about staying non-committal and not responible for others' emotional wellbeing, and I worry that another visit from you would make you more emotionally dependent on me, which would inevitable eventually lead to me hurting you.

I'm going to stop here.  Believe it or not, there is much that I have written, but I want to keep this as clear and concise as possible.  I'm not saying that you should definitely not come to Montreal again, but hopefully I've given you some kind of idea about why I'm hesitant.  Maybe you would like to write a response, or if you like we can have a chat tomorrow (today, Sunday) around 3pm your time?

I hope this has been helpful Signe.  Maybe I sound overly analytic, and I know I've already told you a bunch of this stuff, but I wanted to give a general overview of how I feel about all this.  As always, I'm hopeful that, being two reasonable, nice people, we'll be able to work this out as much as possible.

Off to paint now.  Talk to you soon.

Jeremy.


strengthens an image you have of a future together, and makes you more emotionally invested in the possibility of future visits, and eventually future of being together in a more permanent way.  


I think the role of a lover is a very special and important one.  In my worldview, this is the only personal relationship in your life that you choose, and you only choose one, at least one at a time (you have only one mother but you don't choose her; you choose your friends but you have many).  This means that every romantic relationship will either end

I have all kinds of Darwinian explanations for why this is so, but the point is, by committing to one, you are foregoing all others (a prinicple explicitly stated in many marriage vows).  This also means that when you take a new lover, any old lover that was still somewhat attached to you will be ripped away, often with much pain.  (Same can happen if you just decide you don't want any lover, though taking a new lover is a bit more decisive.)  The upshot is, when you enter a romantic relationship with someone, you are implicitly agreeing to either stay with them forever or eventually cause them pain.  Of course, in any close relationship people will eventually hurt each other, but with romance, I feel like the pain is all the more tragic because it is the pain of taking away everything you have ever given that person.  When a couple breaks up, there's a sense in which all the good memories and bonds they've built now turn against them and become reminders of the impermanence of all good things.  I think I told you about haning out with Findlay and the widow of my late friend Al, Katherine.  Five years after his death, she's still a wreck.  I asked her whether it's really better to have loved and lost; she's not sure.

This is a big part of why I was so averse to entering a relationship for so many years.  After the relationship Andree and I built for years vanished into smoke, I felt like there's no point getting involved with another one, unless I was sure it was going to last, and I wasn't at all sure I wanted one that was going to last, and certainly didn't meet anyone who changed my mind.  So, no girlfriend for 8 years, minus that 6 month slip back with Jen.  Then, driven partly by my celibacy, I travelled, hoping that the impermanent nature of my stay would prevent me from

Hi Signe,

Well it's been 3 weeks since our last communication.  I didn't deliberately mean to cut off all contact, I was just uncertain how to proceed, how long to wait, and whether to even communicate at all.  I think we've both made it pretty clear where we stand in terms of how we view our relationship, at least as clear as possible, as clear as we understand it ourselves.  Unfortunately that doesn't mean it's clear what to do about it.  So for a long time I just did what I usually do when I don't know what to do:  nothing.  But I do miss you, I miss staying in touch with you, and I want to know what you're up to.  So I'm just going to start with this little update message and see how it goes from here.

Basically all's well here, and not terribly different from since last time we chatted.  Work continues to go quite well.  I recently went from being a kind of technical assistant to lighters to being a regular lighter, and then last week, I started trying my hand at full-on software development, which I haven't done much of.  So lots of different tasks, lots of learning, and hopefully it's all headed toward making best use of both my computer-math-technical skills and my visual-artistic aspects.  I still feel like it's the best job I've ever had, but I still wish it were 25-30 hrs/week instead of 40-45.  Such is life.

Another development recently:  Last weekend, my cousin with that horrible illness finally died.  Her whole weird family - the husband and 3 sons - were all in town, and my whole family came in as well, and we went to the funeral and the "shiva", which is the 7 days of receiving visitors at the home of the deceased (though they only did 3 days, and I only attended 2).  It was all a suitibly sombre affair, certainly not shocking to anyone - she's come very close to dying a few times in recent years - and there was even a certain relief that her suffering was over, but still very emotional of course, in that weird Aspergers way particular to my cousins.  Apparently there was also another big blow-up between my mom and Tom at a breakfast that I'm somewhat glad to have missed.

Also on the subject of endings, on Monday Paul moved to Toronto.  As you know, we've been growing apart over the years, and we'd seen very little of each other since he got back from his gig out East this Summer, but last Saturday I helped him pack up the legendary apartment he'd been living in for almost 10 years, and he bought me dinner and drinks and we went to a halloween party, then the next night we and a few drinks with a couple other friends.  It was kind of a sweet, sentimental weekend of being like best friends again, and I got to see some of his insecurities and vulnerabilities -- though of course, actor that he is, I'm never truly sure what's for show and what's genuine.  I guess that's somewhat true for all of us.  Anyway, I think our relationship might work better living in different cities.  I wish him limited success in Toronto.

In other news, or not news, I'm still working on that same goddamn bridge painting, but now it looks a bit like that first picture I sent you of it.  I discovered that brush cleaner can be used to remove paint, and, over the course of a couple weeks, I ended up erasing almost the entire thing!  A very strange experience that's been.  Now there's a kind of ghostly reminant of what the painting was a couple weeks ago, when I sometimes convinced myself that it was almost finished.  I don't regret erasing it, I like this ghostly effect, but it does only add to these profound existential questions my painting practice had been presenting lately.  You may recall that I was questioning the point of painting, since most of my work ends up just stacked in my studio unseen by anyone.  Now the practice of spending many dozens of hours - and lots of costly materials - to end up with an almost-blank canvas is taking the nihilistic futility of this passtime to a new level.  I kind of enjoy that though.  And I do still have a faint hope that, EVENTUALLY, this will end up being my best work.  We'll see.

Meanwhile, virtually nothing new on the lady front.  I saw the Rocky Horror Show a few weeks ago, with Angela in the chorus.  We chatted for about 5 minutes afterwards, a bit tense but amicable.  And that was it.  She mentioned me briefly in her blog right afterwards, but not since.  It feels truly over, and no attempt to reunite, even "as friends", seems imminent.  I'm quite glad about that.

Oh yeah, also, the day after you sent your last message, we had a federal election, which I watched on TV with Jen and Marika.  It was a pretty dramatic election, with a lot of polarized views about the encument 9-year-ruling conservative Stephen Harper, though almost all the people I know (except my parents) are artsy-lefty types who hate him.  For me the most interesting aspect of the whole event was having heated debates with people close to me about abstract questions regarding the nature of democratic government and whether voting really makes a difference (I spoiled my ballot).  I must admit, though, I'm pleased that the hot young liberal guy ended up winning.  But whatever.

So that's the update here.  I'd like to know what your up to.  I saw that FB picture of your alien insect thing, it looks beautiful and horrifying all at the same time.  I guess that course is all done now and you're in... Denmark?  Or Panama already?  Or elsewhere?

Again, I'd like to hear from you.  I don't know if you're into the whole long-email thing.  If you want to chat that would be great too.  But of course, I realize the very act of maintaining contact has implications, that it might further entangle us and prevent us from moving on to more, shall we say, productive relationships, as you mentioned in your last email, and that "ripping off the band-aid" might be the most healthy way forward.  But to me, it just feels depressing to think that all we built together has to be discarded, as if we never met - like a completely erased painting, if you will.  It might be true.  Sometimes you have to let go of things, painful and depressing though it is.  But sometimes not.  Anyway, although in your last message you said you wanted to "terminate this", you also said I can feel free to email you any time, so that's what I'm doing.

I do hope your well.  I do think about you a lot, and I would like to hear from you.  But it's up to you.  If you want to send an update message, or arrange a chat, that would be most welcome.

Jeremy.


, I recently went from being a kind of technical assistant to lighters to being a regular lighter, which is more of a "shot-assembler", not a lot of creative or artistic work, just putting the components together and churning out sequences of images.  Then, with that experience under my belt, I started w

So, happy anniversary!

Ya it would be great if we could coordinate a path-crossing again -- although this potential Bhutan option sounds exciting too!  I confess I had never even heard about that country till you mentioned it.  Soooo many countries in the world....

Ya I remember you had just had some somewhat dramatic personal times with your twin friend and a former love who you'd reunited with in Europe... details foggy... For me Ljublijana was a pivotal destination, as it marked the end of the expensive, north/western portion of my trip and the beginning fo the Balkans and Eastern Europe proper.  Just after my rail pass ran out, which meant I could stop rushing around trying to use up my remaining rides before the pass expired, and could finally relax.  I stayed a week.  Loved that town, and our hostel!




TASK MANAGER
#Make it so that when you press enter, item data is saved
#Clean up a bit
#Dish# get Task data structure going
#D# Make it not show root
#D# Get it to write to disk -- in "json"?
#D# Make buttons for "ready to start" "hold" "in progress" "DONE"
#Dish# Cause buttons to set current task status and colour accordingly

Make button for
	"add subtask"
	"delete subtask"
	"backup"

Next to the status buttons:
	Checkboxes for which statuses to show
	Buttons to expand those statuses


Satus dependencies - let's see...
	If any of the subtask is not DON, the whole shot is not DON
	If any of the subtask is PRG, the whole shot is PRG
	If any of the subtask is DEP, the whole shot is DEP
		Hmm, but what if some subtasks are PRG and some are DEP?  Maybe PRG bg and DEP fg?
		Then again, it's entirely possible that a single shot will have many statusses - REV, FRM, DEP, PRG... 
		Maybe you could have "promote" buttons, at least for those 4, that would colour code a shot according to whether it has that status, eg. "promote PRG" colours all tasks with in-progress subtasks orange.
		On the other hand, I suppose that could be dealt with in filters -- only SHOW shots with such subtask statuses.
		In that case, I suppose we could have a semi-arbitrary hierarchy, eg: DEP, REV, PRG, FRM, DON

What of layers within a shot -- HC, FG, BG....???



Sort

Promotion:
	have a list of promotion prio such that a task inherits the highest prio statusses of subtasks, eg:
		promo = ["prg", "dep", "rev", "ren", "don", "arc"]
	have buttons that will promote each

Figure this out:  just cuz a task's dependencies is done doesn't mean a task is done!  Maybe top-level "shot" tasks (eg. FWA_0810) are the ones that automatically inherit "done"
Perhaps some tasks are "taskGroup"s (isTaskGroup = True) + have proper "subTasks", others are more proper "tasks" to be done w/ "dependencies".
When a taskGroup's subtasks are done, the taskGroup is done.
When a task's dependencies are done, the task is "in progress" (aka ready to work on).

UI changes:
	Top row = notes
	2nd row = delete task / rename task / delete task / dialog
	3rd row = status buttons / tree (note order)


buttons:
	Rename task
	Archive done
	Show archives

Features:
	self.recentlyTouched -- each time selectionChanges, recentlyTouched *= k (0 < k < 1)
	self.lastTouched -- for archive purposes

Eventually:
	Install priority concept
		Allow shots to be sorted by it
		Auto-generate a todo list based on "prg" and prio

I got a bit obsessed with Scandinavian song - don't remember whether it was Swedish or Norwegian or what - from an "Introducing Scandinavia" CD I bought in the same shopping spree where I bought the Estonian one, in preparation for my big European trip a couple years ago.  It was extremely "consonant" - I think that's the word, no sharps or flats - like a jaunty children's song, almost saccharine, complete with happy accordian and half-step-up key change near the end, but it was sooooo goooood!  I've since lost it, but it's a life goal to find/replace it one day...

EXPLORE CONTOUR LINES

The basic idea (simplest case):
Goal: separate the image into quantized fields of intensity (could be other variable eg. hue), eg. 4 fields: <.25; <.5; <.75; <1.  (Only upper limits are given for shorthand purposes; "<.75" actually means ">.5 and <.75".)
We are considering not the pixels, but the joints between the pixels.

Drawing vertices:
	Traverse joints.  (This entails traversing pixels, and for each pixel considering the SW corner, ie. joint, and its neighbouring 4 pixels.)
	If any of the joint's 4 neighbour pixels are in different fields (eg. one is <.25, another is <.5), put a CORRESPONDING vertex there.
	By "corresponding", we mean corresponding to the appropriate contour line, so in the above example, you would draw a ".25" vertex.  In the unusual case where multiple contour lines were crossed - eg. some neighbour pixels were <.25 and some were <.75 - you would draw a .25 and .5 vertex, even if no pixels were <.5.
	Each vertex includes 2 connection directions, con0 and con1, each one of NESW (must be different).  So options are:

	|  _|  |_   _  _  __
	|          |    |

	First: con0 = (0,1), con1 = (0,-1)
	Second: con0 = (0,1), con1 = (-1,0)
	Third: con0 = (0,1), con1 = (1,0)
	... (order or con0 or con1 doesn't matter)

Connecting vertices
	# Traverse joints
	for x in range(xres):
		for y in range(yres):
			thisVert = verts[x][y]
			if thisVert: # If not Null, there is a vert here.
				If vertex does not belong to a curve:
					#Create a new curve object newCurve, which includes a linked list
					class Curve:
						def __init__(self, joints, seedVert):
							self.head = seedVert
							self.tail = seedVert
							# joints is a pointer to an array of joints

							self.joints = joints
							# add vert seedVert to verts.
							self.addVerts(seedVert, addToTail=0)
							self.addVerts(seedVert, addToTail=1)



						def reverseDir(xy):
							return (-xy[0],-xy[1])

						
						def addVert(self, thisVert, addToTail=0):
							if addToTail:
								self.tail.next = thisVert
								thisVert.prev = self.tail
								self.tail = thisVert
							else:
								self.head.prev = thisVert
								thisVert.next = self.head
								self.head = thisVert
						# What about when a loop closes?

						def addVerts(self, thisVert, dirArrivingFrom, addToTail=0):
							self.addVert(thisVert, addToTail)
							thisVert.added = True
							if con0 == dirArrivingFrom:
								nextVertDir = reverseDir[con1]
							else:
								nextVertDir = reverseDir[con0]
							nextVert =

Hey buddy,

As I've said many times when discussing your lyrics (and these seem a bit reminiscent of your style), peotic license allows for unconventional use of language, so my notes below are pointing out passages that are technically incorrect or at least a little odd, but they may still be permissable for poetry.

"my soul's a fellow fat" - putting the adjective (fat) after the noun (fellow) is not generally done, although it might have been the style in olde English, like you suggested.
miry - I'm not familiar with this word, and although the dictionary does define it as "very muddy or boggy", I think it's very rarely used - probably related to the line in the Doors' Light My Fire, "No time to wallow in the mire".
bodies bog - yes it's probably supposed to be body's bog.
consistence - the dictionary lists this alongside "consistency", but I've never encountered it, I've only encountered "consistency", "consistent", "consist", etc.
why you don't die - You're right, this is not the correct form of a question, it should be "why don't you die".
why you stick on me - should be "why do you stick on me".
empty bowles -> I assume they meant "empty bowels" (guts) - or, less likely, "empty bowls".

Hope that helps!

Jeremy.

Hey Mike,

Cheque is in the mail.  This is probably totally unnessessary but on the envelope it's addressed to "Dave Green" (the cheque has your real name), hope that doesn't cause problems or confusion.

Hey I gotta ask, has the rate for magic changed?  It seems like I got quite a bit more last time for 200, magic and lots of other stuff, compared to 300 for just magic this time, and less of it.  When I last wrote I hadn't yet opened the packages so I didn't realize how little there was.  Varieties 2 and 3 each filled about 25% of the vials you'd sent before, which, as I recall, were mostly filled in the last order, and Variety 1 was somewhat less.  Is there more coming?  The rate for the paper is great though.

I wish I could give you a more nuanced, sommelier-style assessment of each batch and its particular effects, but I think I always find the experience so overwhelming that it's hard to make such subtle distinctions.  And of course, much noise is added thanks to the influence of set and setting, plus the variability of experience within one batch.  Also, there's usually some residue in my pipe from previous batches, and I've been reusing the vials you sent, so there's plenty of cross-contamination between batches.  It doesn't matter much to me, it's all good, but yeah, I'm not much use for providing per-batch descriptions, just reports of magic in general.  (I'm the same way with other things, eg. I can't tell strains of green apart - gourmand, not gourmet.)

I did try some of variant 1, combined with some left over from an old batch (I combined them because the quantity of old was insufficient for a breakthrough).  Good stuff - I'm getting more familiar with that world and its colourful 2D inhabitants.  This time it felt like I was at a colloseum or fairground with bleachers, there was a kind of flat board with a cutout figure in the middle, gesturing at me.  Also, a few weeks ago, I had another nice journey where I was in a spaceship-thing with floor-to-ceiling windows, a bit like Emperor Palpatane's throne room, with a couple of those flat creatures facing me from their seats.

Of course, as always, these descriptions are inadequate approximations of my vague and fantastical memories of the experiences.  I am hoping to try again soon, first smoking the rue - my old pipe is quite "cleaned out" now and is ready to take on its role as a dedicated rue pipe, with vapor genie taking on magic duties.  Looking forward to some more prolonged trips.

I shared some of Variety 1 with my buddy, but he didn't break through.  I had smoked first, and I thought I had put in enough for both of us to have a breakthrough, but maybe I had taken too much of it.  After about an hour, I added more and he tried again, but again, no dice.  He'd tried magic once before elsewhere and hadn't broken through.  Maybe he wasn't using the vapor genie right - or is it possible that some people are just immune, or have a very high tolerance?  It certainly wasn't the fault of the product, since it worked for me, and I'm pretty sure his dosage was at least as much as mine.

I'll keep you posted about future adventures, as always.  Lemme know when you get my cheque.

Jeremy.



What lovely photos!  They really took me back, seeing that lush foliage and those mazy ruins made of volcanic rock.  I even recognized that little restaurant at the start of the trail to the Welcome Center, where we last saw each other.  There were some few familiar faces in there - Stella of course, but also that German dude with the big grey dreads - Michael maybe? - and that other really warm and friendly skinny guy with darkish skin who played guitar and seemed to be a central facilitator at the Gathering.  It's so cool that you got to spend more time with those gentle souls, and even took part in the scouting process for future gatherings.  Are you becoming a through-and-through Rainbow Sister?  Are you going to forsake all possessions and abandon formal education and official employment and permanent addresses and spend your life merrily prancing from one Gathering to the next?  And to think, when I first met you, you were almost as foreign to the Rainbow phenomenon as I was (apart from your brief visit to that other Gathering).

Once, we were gathering firewood at the Gathering and I dropped a log on my left big toe.  I've been watching the  resulting bruise slowly make its way up my toenail, and it always reminds me of that time.  It's near the edge now - it will be with melancholy sentiment that I eventually pick out the scabby bits as they emerge.

I'm so sorry to hear about the fire at your friend's eco-project!  That's the one that you had worked at before Rainbow, and that you had planned to work at again but went adventuring with Rainbow people instead, right?  That must be devastating, to have such a personal labour of love destroyed after so much work.  But, like you say, it's a good thing most of their land was spared, and no one was killed.  A good chance to practice the fine art of letting go I guess - it feels like there have been many opportunities for that lately.  This is a much less serious matter, but even this very cafe where I'm writing, Navarino, one my favourite neighbourhood haunts, is closing on Saturday, after over 50 years in business!  Gotta learn to embrace impermanence, which is difficult for a nostalgic fellow like myself.  Anyway, I hope your friends are recovering ok.

I've still been living a very liesurely life in Montreal, although times have been a bit emotional recently - a friend who I've known since preschool died a couple weeks ago, following 6 very difficult years with breast cancer.  It's been painful, particularly since many of my friend's relationships were quite fraught, especially with her mother, so people are trying reconcile a lot of conflicting emotions.  The survivors are forming a nice little support network though, which is really helpful for everyone.  Again, more change, more letting go.  Better get used to it, I guess.

Apart from that, all is well.  I completed (for now) my computer project and submitted it to a festival, I should find out sometime in the next week or two whether it's been accepted, though there are plenty others to apply to.  Now I'm taking a bit of a break from the computer to focus on painting, among other things.  I kinda softly promised myself I would look into getting work for the new year sometime this week - we'll see how that goes.

Thanks for alerting me about the photos, they were so much fun to look at.  Oh, and I have attempted surfing before - you're right, it is harder than it looks, I don't think I successfully stood on the board!  I did, however, feel the "click" of catching a wave while paddling on my belly, and I caught a glimpse of that cosmic connections surfers rave about, and could see the addictive potential.

I imagine you're in the process of completing that Environmental Science course, back in civilized England (and not yet living in the woods full time).  How's that going?  Do you know when it will be done?  Do you have a specific plan after that?  If you do plan to travel, I reiterate, Montreal is lovely, even without Navarino!

Take care,

Jeremy.

ps.  Somewhat predictably, work on that Rainbow/Nowhere travelogue has been slow going - I still pick away at it from time to time, but I haven't been very disciplined.  Better hurry, the memories aren't getting any fresher.





=========================
FB slower + fade in (as we had tried), earlier

Vol slow fade in
(comp only) inCrowd earlier - at climax


Funny, I was telling my buddy the other day that the cliche drug addict will say "I won't do it again tonight, I won't do it again tonight," then that night, "Oh just one more time", whereas with this stuff it's more like "I'll do it tonight, I'll do it tonight", then that night, "....mmmaybe tomorrow."  Well, after some days of this procrastination - partly because I've been shakind the dregs of a cold - I finally had a go at the glassy yellow stuff tonight.  No point-in-a-joint yet, but I did 3 hauls of a 2-finger pinch of rue, waited 10, then hit the genie.

Full breakthrough, with pretty clear vision of being inside a long cylinder, tiled with multicoloured symbols, as one of those Keith Harring figures raced up and down the tube, doing kind of cannonball flips.  The next part is visually patchy, but there was that familiar sublime feeling that earthly pursuits, social esteem, relationships etc. were naive distractions that totally miss the point of existence.  Although the breakthrough was pretty complete, I felt like I regained a toehold on "reality" - ie. on the fact that I was a person in a place who had just taken a drug - more quickly than usual, and I would occasionally flutter my eyes open for an instant to witness my surroundings, rendered as they were in dazzling bejeweled patterns.  In the waning stages, the fabric of the world was presented as a meshwork of beings with carnival-mask faces and multicoloured fingers made of piston/syringes, compassionately putting me "back to bed" as I reeled from my glimpse of true reality.  The usual morbid sense was perhaps underscored by the recent death of a lifelong friend following 6 years of cancer.  Tucked into my duvet, I was reminded of her last days in the hospice bed, fading out of consciousness and slowly resigning herself to oblivion, and I felt like I was indeed in my deathbed.  I was siezed by convulsive shivering, but resisted the temptation to wrap the covers tighter around me, instead trying to "ride" the tremors, like my late friend used to ride waves when she surfed.  At one point I defiantly exclaimed "fucking BRING IT!", which seemed to diminish the spasms, and then I settled back into bed and let the magic effects drain away.

You may recognize much of this from my previous descriptions - Harring figures, patterned environments, mask-faced syringe-fingered beings putting me to bed, existential confusion, shivering but eschewing the shallow comfort of physical warmth, etc.  I'm glad to get more acquainted with these motifs, but I still feel like they go by a bit too quick.  I think the rue slowed it down, but only a bit, maybe stretching the peak from 7 to 12 minutes or so, which is a welcome change, but still not in the ballpark of my most successful tea trip, which lasted well over an hour.  Next up, I think I'll try taking deeper hauls of the rue, and then point-in-a-joint - I'm hopeful that a more gradual fade into magic-land will allow me to retain more of the experience, as this trip was again dazzlingly abrupt.  Also, I'm curious to try keeping my eyes open more, and I do want to try the tea again.  I'll keep you posted.  Thanks again.

Jeremy.


"I highly recommend rue+spice doobie" - dude, GOOD ADVICE, thanks for persevering!

Last night, I drank rue tea, waited about 1 hr, and smoked what I eyeballed to be "a point" of the non-glassy Brazillian stuff in a sizable joint with a bit of tobbacco.  My god!  The slow unraveling of reality was a welcome change from the blinding blast-off of the pipe/genie; I felt like Max in Where the Wild Things Are, staying in his room while the walls dissolved and the room transformed, or Little Nemo gently transported to fantastical worlds while remaining in bed.  And what fantastical worlds they were!  Not the glossy, pristine symbol-land I sometimes go to, but more organic Dr. Seuss play-doh forms that I'd seen in other journeys.  As you suggested, this method does seem to offer more control in that you can pace your intake to taste, but I think I still overshot the mark a bit and slipped into the amnesia zone - probably would have been better if I'd stopped a toke or two earlier.  Nonetheless, I did retain one fairly vivid vision: two massive, curved walls of what appeared to be spaceships, rolling against each other, resembling the hulls of galleons, covered in patterns that evoked wooden planks and portholes, but which also seemed like faces with tongues shallowly protruding from vaginal mouths, all rendered in soft tissue that was both organic and technological.   Each face seemed individually conscious, but so did each ship, and so did the entire field of experience, which reminded me of my very first trip, where the patterns of cloth near me exhibited similar levels of individual and collective consciousnesses.  It was great having the "slow wade" into this world rather than the "cannonball dive", and it was fun to feel my grip on the normal-consciousness world thin out to flimsy tendril, slipping in and out of my grasp.  I tried experimenting with eyes open and closed, but I was definitely drifting into a space where I couldn't tell the difference.  I did a fair bit of musing out loud, about biology and sex, as I recall - I can't say HOW loud, I hope I was just kinda muttering, though for all I know I was bellowing it to all my neighbours.  I'm thinking I might audio-record the next trip (which I had done for the previous one, though I don't think I said much of interest).  The effect subsided after maybe 20 min, and I was left feeling just pot-stoned, and totally jazzed.  I felt much more euphoric than usual, muttering "wow", "that was AMAZING!" etc., face froze in a grin.  Curiously, there wasn't really any terror, or much soul-shaking existential insight - it was more of wildly fantastical show.

So, I'll definitely be doing that again - probably in about 1hr, with what's left of that joint.  I feel like it's also a good way to introduce friends to the stuff, since the slow intake allows one to interactively tweak the dosage, and the pot is kind of like an old friend holding your hand and chaperoning you through this new world.

A few questions:

Though I appreciate weed's role in complimenting the magic effect, I'd rather if I wasn't quite so stoned afterwards.  Given this, and the fact that I'd like a slower-yet take-off (with the genie standing by for on-demand breakthrough if need be), and the fact that I don't want too much tobbacco, I was thinking of packing a bunch of lotus in the joint.  If I understand correctly, the lotus serves padding, flavour, and texture functions, but has no psychoactive effect.  Do you recommend this?

Do you use tobacco in your joints?

How long after drinking the rue should I smoke?  I believe in the past you've said 20 or 40 minutes.

How long does the rue tea effect last?  Was waiting 1 hr before smoking too long?

Is there any point in combining smoked + drunk rue?

How long does rue tea keep?  Hours?  Weeks?

Re. rue tea, I know I've asked you about this a few times already, but I still feel like I'm not brewing it.  it gave me well over an hour of high flying in that legendary trip a couple years ago, but I've never approached that duration since.  Here's my recipe:

1.5 cups water
1.5 tsp lemon juice
1 generous pinch of rue finely ground in a coffee grinder (that is, 1 pinch when ground, not when whole)

Combine ingredients and simmer for 40 min, filter with a coffee filter, refrigerate, drink.

The result did look piss yellow, not too orange/brown, and this time I think I did start feeling slightly groggy after 30-40 min, but not nauseous.  Given all the varying variables - new batch, new joint technique - it's hard to say what caused what, but I would guess that the rue did prolong the experience, but again, nothing like that epic journey years ago.  You've also mentioned something about double-filtering, but I don't remember what you meant by that.

Sorry for asking you to walk me through this again, I've combed our previous conversations and gotten bits and pieces of your technique, but I'd like to have it in one succinct recipe, plus maybe it's evolved over the years.  I promise I'll mark it for safekeeping!  (I've also looked online but there are 100 opinions about it of course.)

Probably gonna drink that tea now, then paint while listening to Rumi, then finish that joint.  Can't wait!


Jeremy.

Ha ha, I didn't realize the point-in-joint was your innovation!  Good one, I'll pass it on.

Thanks for all the answers, and for spelling out your recipe.  I'll try that.

Last night's follow-up wasn't quite as spectacular, but certainly not fruitless.  The remaining roach wasn't enough to take me all the way, so I hit the genie afterwards with more of the non-glassy Brazilian.  I had a kind of "soft breakthrough", bringing me to a curious liminal space I'd been to before: I never totally broke with reality, was always somewhat aware of who/what/where I was, but when I closed my eyes I could see the other world, this time inhabited by 2-3 blue-black smoky creatures resembling The Babadook, each of whose dark bodies were formed by the intersection of 2 cloudy-sky-blue planes that divided the space in a somewhat cubist manner.  I was embedded in a thicket of gears which these creatures were manipulating from afar using levers as they looked down on me, and my vocal apparatus was caught up in these machinations, causing me to sputter mechanical sounds (I have an audio recording of this).  There was a taught, trembling, cob-webby texture to this world, which seemed to hover above regular reality - I could see it by rolling my eyes up into their sockets, then flip back to my room by opening my eyes.  The two worlds seemed contiguous, like in The Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind, when the camera pans seamlessly from the bookstore to the guy's living room.  This theme of smokey creatures inhabiting a cob-webby world just outside of my field of vision is quite common in the latter stages of my journeys, just before I turn away from that world and resume my life in this one.

Looking forward to trying the proper tea with a fresh joint, I'll keep you posted.

Jeremy.

Re. your response:
"In my field it is a consensus" - meaning if I asked a random sample of lawyers, the vast majority would agree that you are making 77% of what a male would make doing the same job?  References?  In my view, the fact that you are a lawyer does not qualify you to know what the consensus among lawyers is, any more than me being a Canadian makes me a an authority on what Canadians think.

"If I was a black latina I'd be making 68 or 56 cents."  References?

I didn't say there was wasn't a pay equity problem - don't put words in my mouth, I choose them very carefully.  I said it's misleading for you to imply that you're making 77% of what a man would make doing the same work.  My point in listing the above quotes is not to say you're definitely wrong in every way, but to show that the matter is much more complicated and controversial than your statement implies.  I expect there is a real pay equity problem, but you shouldn't have to exaggerate by misusing statistics.  Doing so discredits you and your cause.

Let me be very clear:  My quibble is not so much about what the reality of pay inequality is, it's with how you go about determining what is true.  I suspect that you are, deliberately or not, skewing the results to most dramatically emphasize what you already believe.  This confirmation bias is happening all over the political spectrum; everyone sub-culture is living in its own version of reality, increasingly divergent from and hostile to one another, which makes productive discussion increasingly difficult.



I am not trying to defeat you for the thrill of winning a debate, but I feel I must challenge you.  The fact that


and it's making it impossible to reach a consensus of what the truth is, and hope for productive discussion.




I am not saying there is no gender pay equity problem.
I am not saying it has been PROVEN that you would be making the same amount if you were male.
I am questioning how you choose which facts you believe, and how you interpret them.  My most severe accusation is that you are, deliberately or not, 




When you exaggerate it a) discredits you in general b) implies that there isn't enough authentic data to justify your grievance, hence your need to exaggerate.  If you have a legit grievance, you don't have to exaggerate.  The truth should be shock 

U  If your grievances are real, you shouldn't have to exaggerate and misrepresent statistics; doing so might make a big splash but it discredits you and your cause.nless by "in my field" you mean "among the people I associate with".  This, of course, speaks to the proliferation of "truths" that we are witnessing, which has led the left and right to live in completely different worlds while objective truth becomes a romantic, obsolete notion.ing enough.

Hello, I'm trying to convert an image sequence of .png's into a Quicktime movie in ProRes 422 format on Linux.  I am submitting this to a film festival is crucial that it be in EXACTLY this format.  I have been using ffmpeg like so (note the film is 10 frames per second):

ffmpeg -start_number 0 -f image2 -r 10 -i image.%04d.png -i ~/Desktop/aud/aud_01.wav -codec:v prores -profile:v NUMBER -r 10 -strict -2 final.mov

I've tried various options for NUMBER following -profile:v, then checked the resulting video codec by using the "Properties" function in linux's totem media player.  Here are the results I get:

0 = Apple ProRes Proxy
1 = Apple ProRes LT
2 = Apple ProRes
3 = Apple ProRes HQ

Are any of these ProRes 422?  I've already submitted option 3, Apple ProRes HQ, and the festival is not yet sure they can accept it.  Is there something else I should be doing?

Thank you,

Jeremy.

Half a shot glass of rue ground to fine powder. 
Wrap powder in coffee filter, twist and secure with a twist tie.  
Place rue bag in a tea ball.  
Place tea ball in a 1/2 full mason jar of distilled water
Add 1.5 tsp of fresh lemon juice.  
Have a pot of water ready boiling. 
Place mason jar in the pot of boiling water so that the level of the water in the pot reaches the same level as the water in the mason jar - maybe have a colander or something similar in the pot so the mason jar does not touch the bottom of the pot (i've had jars crack on the bottom of the pot due to heat)

Boil for about 30min. 

Remove, let cool and drink.  

I found the tea is usually only good for one breakthrough a session. Maybe if the sessions were spread out over 3-4hrs you could do it again but i'm not sure about that.

Couple more regie questions:
	If I buy property, can I rent it?
Analyze my finance flow:
	Figure out what my income, expenses (rent vs. non-rent), + % of time employed have been for last few years
	Figure out approx % time employed necessary for former rent
	Adjust for new projected housing costs (for 300k)

	Improve analyzer:
		#Dish# Store entries as date|difference|balance(|source?)
		#Dish# Sort by difference to find the biggest withdrawals + deposits
		Fix the - in balance
		Sanity check that it matches web content
	Maybe compare with ROA etc.

DEV IDEAS
Transmit aov from timeWarp to curves to sync "layer"s.
	Problem: all sids on a layer will merge to one as it fades to black + white.
	Eventual possible solution: sid fades in somewhere > 0, out somewhere < 1 -- never fully merges.
	Maybe also try (maybe to start) alternately fading in + out odd vs. even layers but not animating the layer offset.
Try to spawn hole-less sids into disks -- and maybe one-hole sids into rings?
Connect sid to opacity value + use that to matte texture, instead of using trim curves.
	Trim curves and nucurves can maybe fade back in to do disk xform.
tw: squish cars driving downward by something like:
	oldTime = max(0, currentTime + 1- 1/y)
	timeToLookUp = mix(currentTime, oldTime, y)







==================
=== TUE MAY 09 ===
==================
Buy tic to Spain
Reorganize code
	#Dish# Put all in one dir + test
	Setup git + commit mnc, curves, tw

BIG PICTURE dev plans
	Ultimate goal: something like, have sids start dark, then creep up the light hill untill they reach a threshhold, at which point they sustain + maybe drift + morph eg. to disks or rings.
	
Oh god... try to break it down:
	A "layer" is all the sids that are at a given (intensity) level at a given frame.
	A "lseq" (layer sequence) is a sequence of corresponding layers.
		Innovation: "corresponding" does not have to correspond to

tidDic!
Eventually: you probably don't have to save all surfGrids.

==================
=== FRI MAY 26 ===
==================

WARP - TID SEEMS TO WORK!  Next steps:
Clean code.
Bunch of little fixes
	Does the image necessarily get rendered as soon as you load it? -- probably shouldn't
	Per-seq parms
	Render/data versioning
		
	Have another go at dynamic menu contents, for db names and levels
	Change frame to within range immediately after switching image, before creating dirs.

Store inSurfGrid as self.inSurfGridPrev instead of saving + reloading.
	Note: the only reason to save inSurfGrid might actually be to make tid db img.

save dics - tid, sid, curves
	What actually needs to be stored?
		Whole seq:
			tidToSids
			sidToTid
		Per frame:
			sidToCvs
Versioning
	with overwrite checkboxes for data, (tid,?) ren

Ofs/level related stuff:
	Fix the jarring ofs reset - needs some thinking.
	gamma
	lev should only go so lo so as to avoid tids that fill entire frame.

Do low res processMov for puppets.


EVENTUALLY:
	Diagnostics

THE FUN STUFF - try an initial ren() method:
	As a first satisfying test of tid in action, have tids "fall into frame" a la MontR finale:
		Isolate a limited frame range, eg. 30f, in its own src dir eg. div_small
		First, just try an explicit, tid-driven render (ignoring lev for now):
			At each fr:
				load sidToCvs for this fr
				for each tid:
					sids = tidToSids[tid]
					for sid in sids:
						cv = sidToCvs[sid]
						renCv ... see below

So, renCv.  The idea is you want to save only the curve (outline), not all the pixels in it, but you want to reconstruct the pixels in it.
Maybe:
	init drawGrid with None
	iterate through jts, drawing the curve in drawGrid
	iterate through jts again, for each jt:
		keep traveling along x, drawing pixels as you go, until you hit a non-None in drawGrid


Once you've got that basic version of renCv done, you can do all the fancy stuff:
	Fade them on independently:
		fadeStart = frStart + frange * ran(tid)
		intens = smoothstep(fadeStart, fadeStart + fadeTime, fr)
	Make them fall out of frame:
		ty = intens (of course you'll have to find an antialiased xf system - shouldn't be too had.
	etc.

Prune old tids from tidToSid:
	Save (pickle) new newTids[] for each fr
	load newTids for fr-frPerCycle-1; delete them from dic
	problem: say  frame is f and frPerCycle is c:
		When rendering f, you'd have to use tidToSid from f+c
	solution:
		Just look up that fr.
	problem with solution:
		You must save tidToSid for every frame
	solution to problem with solution:
		at gen-time, at every checkpoint i (let's say i=c):
			cp dataDir/tidToSid in dataDir/prevFrDir (for f-1)
			load dataDir/tidToSid
			del all entries before f-c:
				Add birthFr to tidToSid dic (keep lowest when JOINing)
				While going through the 
		at render-time
			find next checkpoint frame, eg. (fr/c + 1)*c
			If dataDir/checkpointFr/tidToSid* exists, use it (say tidToSid00240_00259)
			otherwise, use dataDir/tidToSid


THOUGHTS ON RENDERING ON GPU
option a: use current renCv algorithm to write out tidGrid, then feed that to GPU.
option b:
	Generate sidToTid (CURRENTLY UNUSED!!  INVESTIGATE!!)
	unzip sidToTid.items() to sortedSids, sortedTids
	make sortedSidPositions dict:
		for i in range(len(sortedSids)):
			sortedSidPositions[sortedSids[i]] = i
	convert inSurfGrid to sortedSidGrid:
		sortedSidGrid[lev][x][y] = sortedSidPositions[inSurfGrid[lev][x][y]]
	feed sortedSidGrid and sortedTids to GPU, where kernel does:
		tid = sortedTids[sortedSidGrid[lev][x][y]]


Do something to ensure you're rendering with correct nextSid, tidToSid:
	Maybe keep track of warpUi.lastGenFr
	Set above to None when you switch seq, vers.
	Use your fancy status bar

PLAN FOR THE RETURN/PROPER ARRIVAL OF BLIT/PYGAME
Convert tidGrid to tidImg (see above).  (Probably better to use tidImg than tidPosImg, just for visualization purposes.)
For each tid:
	Use bbox to cut a sprite from tidImg, srcImg, alpha0Img to *CropImg.
	Blit tidCropImg onto alpha0CropImg using tidClr as A -> tidCropWAphImg
	Copy A from tidCropWAphImg onto srcCropImg -> spriteImg! ie. srcCropWAphImg
	Blit spriteImg onto canvas (/"screen"?)

	Might this have anything to do with your unused sidToTid?


try saving as image?
Store sid + tid grids as image; rename inSurfGrid -> sidGrid


GETTING COLOUR FROM TID:
The idea is to traverse the whole 256^3 colour space while keeping neighbouring tids far away from each other.
Have 8 coners of a "colour cube" so that each colour .5 - ie. max dist - from every other (looping)
Each point defines the min corner of an octant.
After each cycle of 8, increment ocPos = octant position, which will travel through the 128^3 cells in the octant for a total of 128^3 * 8 = (2^7)^3 * 2^3 = 2^21 * 2^3 = 2^24 = (2^8)^3 = 256^3!
Skip tids too dark too see, ie. r + g + b < limit.  (Also could skip too light, too unsaturated -- but not sure if that's useful.)
The resulting values can be transformed into whatever rgb primaries you choose, for actual render purposes.



Try using SHADERS -- maybe my own "unofficial" gpu shaders... hmm, maybe to avoid running gpu on each sprite, you could do it on the whole img using tidGrid - maybe you could also set the alpha with that... somehow:
	makeSprites(
		tidGrid,
		srcGrid,
		tidsSorted,
		tidAttrsSorted, # per tid data pre-calculated in python used by shader, eg xf, prog.
		oRenGrid) # outputs

	At each pixel, srcGrid gets processed according to tidAttrs to make oRenGrid.
	THEN oRenGrid gets blitted onto the sprites according to bbxes.
	Hopefully speed gains since SPRITE SURFACES CAN BE CACHED, + each iteration only oRenGrid needs to be recalculated (1x per lev) and re-blitted to sprites, which are then reblitted.
	
	Make system for parms, eg. @parmName
	Edge/curves


Look into networking 2 laptops/using Big D as server.

Maybe make c plugin for growCurves + maybe other bottlenecks

Tue 28 
Wed 29 FINAL RENDER


rip goes from LIGHTEST TO DARKEST w/in sid (we're trying this with progToNextLev, soso)

STONED
Overall more colour variation eg in bulbs + edges
Maybe try mixing in/out, along with across time
#Dish# Connect bulbiness to alpha - maybe calc in python
Get psudo random clr in fr-offset clr space for all bulbs/edges
Fade BG out more
Fix throbbing bg near beginning


#Dish# See that clrs (incl breath parms) are saved in ren

*********** PLAN OF ATTACK *********** 



#Dish# Check ending
#Dish# 	Implement fadeStart, fadeDur, fadeDelPerLev
		Check BG


MAKE RIPPLE WORK!  "Peel away" layers, new clr glowing beneath
	#Dish -- not directly related# Check parm: moveRippleSpeed
	#Dish# promote calcInRip to fragmod, use it to offset trip used for calcXf
	#Yes and no - fucking seg-fault# stagger per layer, randomize per tid
	for inh and/or exh?

Bulbs come on way too fast -- slow fade, and mult by trip

Is srcImg bright enough?

EDGES:
	Electric pattern radiating out - possibly incorporated with ripple

Connect bulb to opacity:
	Randomize - not every qualifying bulb is a bulb
	Perhaps vary colours, eg. per segment (also play with brightness)
	Rings should not always be in same place.

"WAVES OF SHEEN" passing over sids: white added to/replaces clr.

OVERVIEW
As we lick our wounds following RVCQ's justified rejection, we turn our sights to the surprisingly sympathetic Demoscene's Synchrony event of Jan 19-20.  Specifically... the subway "from NY to MTL"?  (Although the grapplers are inticing -- maybe later.)

TODO:
Move center of clr fade from .5,.5 to parms centX,centY
Compare with pre-travel train vid
#DISH higher nLevels# Make it stop fading in + out -- something about opacity.
Vignette src images from cent to edges

#D# Make juVignetteRound.py
#D# Apply to sub_coming; render
#D# Make juKscope.py to combine these images.

Add fields for:
	srcSeq
	srcVer
	destVer
	txStart
	tyEnd

Buttons
	renSeq

#Dish# have proper ren/kscope/v*** render output system, plus clk (last kscope) alias
#D# display images in (another) standard size optimized for screen
#Dish# Rejig controls so each inSeq has thumbnail
#Dish# get "chrysanthemum" system started... not quite sure how this will work w different clip durations:
#Dish# 	4----
#Dish# 	2   --
#Dish# 	6    ------
#Dish# 	4        ----

Sketch of final clip sequence:

#Dish# Make clip menus trigger version menus 
#Dish# scale input images to standard size
#Dish# when make new output dir, update menu + select new
#D# frChange hotkeys only work when not focused on a field
#D# Hotkeys to nudge parms: up/down->adjust; add alt->adjust and render; add shift->bigger interval
#Dish# UI - maybe make thumnails for beginning, middle, end
Maybe some kind of fr slider that somehow indicates where you are in timeline + where clips come in + out
